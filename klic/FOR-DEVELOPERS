		For Compiler Developers

			Daigo Sekita (Mitsubishi Research Inst., Inc)

With KLIC, the KL1 compiler which are written in KL1 language is
provided, and this program become executable bye compiling and linking
with KLIC system.

Thus, some special treatment is needed if you want to hack the KLIC
compiler.

1) KLIC system must be installed in an ordinary way once. Please be
 sure to 'make install' to keep the compiled compiler.

2) Do 'make clean'.

3) Change the compiler code(s) in the compiler/ directory.

4) 'Configure' again with the argument 'builddist':

	% ./Configure bultddist

This time, Configure program will ask you 'the directory which the
KLIC compiler has been installed'. Then enter the right path to the
directory (The directory was indicated as "KLIC Library Directory"
when you configure'ed at the first time). 

5) Make again.

And the following targets are provided for the convinience of the
developpers.

* clean: Removes all executables, '*.o' and '*.a", and does not remove
the files which are created by the Configure program. Then you can
rebuild the system by just typing 'make'.

* distclean: Removes above files and the files which are created by
the Configure program. This target is convenient to distribute KLIC
to any other platforms.

* verify: Recompiles *.kl1 files to *.c file and compares with the
corresponding old files. This target is to verify the compiler, and if
some differences between versions are found, your compiler may have
some bugs.
