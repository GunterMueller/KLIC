Reliable Multicast Library: RML

The RML is a C library developed under QPL. It is intended to guarantee 
reliable transmission over IP Multicast. We try to develop it in a way that it 
can be used in a large set of applications.

The library runs on GNU/Linux and only require a full functional IP Multicast 
network to work properly.

We provide a simple multicast chat application to test the library and you can 
found it in the rmchat directory. That is the simple way to learn how to build
a multicast application with the Reliable Multicast Library.  

The Tangram-II Whiteboard (TGWB) is an application built on tgif that uses RML.
Further information about TGWB can be found at README.tgwb file.
You can download tgif at http://bourbon.usc.edu/tgif/index.html.

Documentation is available in the doc/ directory.

See AUTHORS for authors' emails and/or homepages.
See LICENSE.QPL for information about QPL.
See INSTALL file for information on compiling the librmcast.

Enjoy it.
