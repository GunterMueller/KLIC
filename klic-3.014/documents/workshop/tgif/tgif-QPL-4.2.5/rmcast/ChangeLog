    - RM_initialize now requires a pointer to a callback function. That function
      will be called whenever we need to terminate and will allow the application
      to clean up its resources before exiting.
    - RM_terminate return type is now void and it calls the callback function
      passed by the application through RM_initialize parameter

    Nov 03,2002
       Allyson
        - RELEASE CANDIDATE 1
        - Added a new debug DSUPPRESSION to generate a log file where each line
          identifies either a retransmition (RT) or a NAK suppression (NK or
          nk). NK indicates that a NAK was suppressed, nk indicates that only a
          position of a NAK was suppressed. See rminternals.c and rmevent.c for
          further info.
        - Added new options to the config file. Now the timer parameters must be
          used as follows:
           TIMER_PARAM_A and TIMER_PARAM_B refers to NAK_SND_WAIT event
           TIMER_PARAM_C and TIMER_PARAM_D refers to RET_RCV_WAIT event
           TIMER_PARAM_E and TIMER_PARAM_F refers to RET_SND_WAIT event

        - Modified generateTimerValue function. Now users can provide parameters
          to calculate the intervals for NAKs and retransmitions
        - Updated 
        - Updated RM_readConfigFile to adapt to the new config file
        - Modified rmcast.config.
            Option added: TIMER_PARAM_A, 
                          TIMER_PARAM_B,
                          TIMER_PARAM_C,
                          TIMER_PARAM_D
            Option modified: HOST_IDENTIFIED
            Now the must indicate the one-way delay for each host identified. 
            New options allows user to control the timer interval.
            See doc/rmcast.config.sample3 for example
        - Improved RM_getOption function. Now almost every option can be
          obtained using this function
        - Replaced functions:
            RM_getHostTimers by RM_getHostDelay
            RM_setHostTimers by RM_setHostDelay
          Now, the timer intervals can be obtained using these functions and the
          timer parameters values as follows:
            - (TIMER_PARAM_A*T,(TIMER_PARAM_A+TIMER_PARAM_B)*T)
              is the time interval for for NAKs
            - (TIMER_PARAM_C*T,(TIMER_PARAM_C+TIMER_PARAM_D)*T)
              is the time interval for for retransmitions
          Where T is the estimated one-way delay to the sender and the timer
          parameters values can be obtained using the RM_getOption function

        - Now we no longer need to provide max_packet_sent parameter to 
          rmcastplot.bash. The file rmcast.c was modified to write the number of
          sent packets in the log file (when log is enabled, of course)
        - Added missing RM_terminate() function call in rmchat.c
        - Updated
            rmcast.c
            tools/scripts/rmcastplot.bash
            tools/scripts/rmlog.awk

        - BUG FOUND & REMOVED: the MAX_MEMBER_CACHE_SIZE and TIMER_DISTRIBUTION
             option was not properly handled in RM_readConfigFile
        - Data or retransmission packets from user i with sn > i.last_seq_rcv
             don't need to be handled (rmcastProcessDataPacket)
        - Updated:
             rminternals.c
             rmcast.c

         - BUG REMOVED regarding infinite loop in the rmcastReceivePackets: the
              problem was caused by a missing pthread_mutex_lock in the 
              rmcastHandleSignals function
         - BUG REMOVED regarding refresh messages handling: there was an 
              incorrect variable reference in the initialization of the for loop
              in the rmcastProcessRefreshPacket function
         - BUG REMOVED regarding sending of retransmissions: wrong ifdef in the
              rmcastCacheContains function
         - Idented some files
         - Created new function cacheCountMembers to count registered members.
              This function will be used to adjust the timers when the
              distribution == EXPONENTIAL
         - Added new defines to rmstruct.h
         - Improved some comments in rmstruct.h
         - Updated
              rminternals.c
              rmevent.c

    Jun 12,2002
       Allyson
         - Included a new field in all RML(Reliable Multicast Library) packets,
           called "flags"
         - Modified files rmstruct.h, rmcast.c, rminternals.c and rmmsgpckt.c to
           add support for the new field "flags"
         - Added new application mcastproxy in the tools directory - using this
           application one can make a "unicast bridge" between 2 or more multicast
           groups. See README in tools/mcastproxy for further info

        - Leave group routines implemented. Now members send a
	LEAVE_GROUP_PACKET before actually leaving the group.
0.8.4
    Apr 22,2002
       Allyson
         - Updated files: README, INSTALL, doc/rmcast.config.README, 
               doc/rmcast.config.sample2, examples/rmchat/rmchat.c
0.8.3
    Apr 14,2002
       Allyson
         - Updated rmlog.awk and rminternals.c to deal with SINGLE_NACK
0.8.2
    Apr 12,2002
       Allyson
         - Some otimization on the code in rmcastReceivePackets related to 
               RET_SND_WAIT event insertion.
         - Rewritten the generateTimerValue function in rmevent.c. Now we can
               generate different timer values to each kind of event.
0.8.1
    Apr 10,2002
       Allyson, Milena & Sadoc
         - Removed some bugs related to some wrong #ifdef in the code
         - New updates in scripts to deal with SINGLE_NACK (again!)
0.8 (cvs tag: single_nack_beta2)
    Apr 08,2002
       Allyson, Milena & Sadoc
         - Updated log functions and scripts to deal with SINGLE_NACK
         - Removed the 0.7 KNOWN BUG
         - Removed references to the DEFAULT_TIMER_VALUE vector in rmevent.c
              when RANDOM_TIMERS is enabled.
         - Update rmcastProcessRefreshPacket function to work properly when
              SINGLE_NACK is enabled.
         - New options available in the doc/rmcast.config.sample2 (see that file 
             for further info):
             MAX_NAK: indicates the max number of nacks that can be sent for each
                      sn.
             MAX_MEMBER_CACHE_SIZE: indicates how many packets we will store for
                                    each member.
         - Removed references to MAX_NAK in all files. Now we are using 
             rmcast_option.max_nak instead of MAX_NAK.
         - Removed references to MAX_MEMBER_CACHE_SIZE in all files. Now we are using 
             rmcast_option.max_member_cache_size instead of MAX_MEMBER_CACHE_SIZE.
           
0.7 (just a bkp version, not functional. cvs tag: single_nack_bkp)
    Apr 03,2002
       Allyson & Milena
         - Bounded, correctly this time, the max number of nack that we can
               send for a packet when using SINGLE_NACK. This number of nacks is
               bounded by the MAX_NAK constant, defined in rmstruct.c
         - Removed some bugs related to the insertion of events when using
              SINGLE_NACK.
         - New debug defines in Makefile:
              Now if you want to debug the FULL cache content you must define
                  DCACHE_CONTENTS in addition of DEBUG_SHOW (see Makefile for
                  further info)
              Now if you want to debug the FULL message content you must define
                  DMSG_CONTENTS in addition of DEBUG_SHOW (see Makefile for
                  further info)
         - KNOWN BUG: sometimes, in a event list node,the IP string and the PID
              change their values to strange ones. This stops the sending of 
              nacks and, in consequence, the sending of data to the application. 

0.6 (cvs tag: single_nack_beta1)
    Mar 31,2002
       Allyson
         - Removed some bugs related to the SINGLE_NACK feature.
         - Added new fields to the log file to support SINGLE_NACK mask logging.
         - Updated tools/scripts/rmcastplot.bash script to deal with the new 
             fields in the log file.
         - Removed some old scripts from the CVS repository.
         - Fixed some (not all) FIXME requests in some files.
         - Improved debug messages.Now we can "barely" understand what they said
         - Implemented generation of UNIFORM random timers. (You must define 
             DRANDOM_TIMERS to enable it. See Makefile for details)
         - New options available in the doc/rmcast.config.sample2 (see that file 
             for further info):
             TIMER_LOWER: this option replace the old AVG_DELAY option. It's the
                          lower bound for the random timers
             TIMER_UPPER: the upper bound for the random timers
             TIMER_DISTRIBUTION: the distribution for the random timers. By now
                                 the only possible distribution is UNIFORM.

        Allyson & Sadoc
          Several bug fixes regarding SUPPORT_FOR_NEW_USERS.
          Using new TGIF(QPL) version 4.1.41.82
          We have created a configuration file (see doc/rmcast.config.README e
            doc/rmcast.config.sample). Now the user can set the protocol
            through the options in that file.
          Now TGWB has no need to define SUPPORT_FOR_NEW_USERS (use rmcast.config
             instead)
          Now "Unicast Mode" is available
          Updated CONTENTS file

     Nov 22,2001
        Allyson, Milena & Sadoc
          Started testing SUPPORT_FOR_NEW_USERS blocks.
          The protocol running without the SUPPORT_FOR_NEW_USERS is working well.

     Nov 12
        Allyson, Milena & Sadoc
          We did some changes regarding RedHat 7.2 gcc compability.
          We didn't test SUPPORT_FOR_NEW_USERS routines.
