Program: tcpdump2rmcast

Converts a file generated by the tcpdump command to the format of rmcast log.

To compile:
 
gcc tcpdump2rmcast.c rmmsgpckt_debug.o -otcpdump2rmcast -Wall                     
 
To execute:
 
./tcpdump2rmcast < log_file 2> out.txt                                    

To generate the tcpdump log file:

tcpdump -lx ip multicast and src host_name > log_file (as root)

Obs.: the showLogMsg() is the same as in rminternals.c, except for line 111,
which is commented.

Please note that the rmmsgpckt_debug.o file is included here for
convenience.  It may be generated by compiling rmcast including the 
option -DDEBUG in DEFINES line of the Makefile of rmcast, and then 
renaming rmmsgpckt.o to rmmsgpckt_debug.o.
