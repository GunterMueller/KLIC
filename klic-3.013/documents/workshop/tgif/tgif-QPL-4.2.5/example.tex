Figure \ref{fig:psfig} is an example of a tgif \LaTeX\,\, figure printed with
the ``psfig'' macro.  As you can see, the figure fits nicely between the
surrounding text.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\input{psfig}
\centerline{\psfig{figure=an-sr-flip-flop.eps}}
\caption{Example Tgif Diagram Printed with ``psfig'' Macro.\label{fig:psfig}}
\end{figure*}

The bounding box seems to be pretty tight.  In
Figure \ref{fig:epsf} below, the same figure is
generated with the ``epsf'' construct.
%
\begin{figure*}[htb]
\input{epsf}
\centerline{\epsffile{an-sr-flip-flop.eps}}
\caption{Example Tgif Diagram Printed with ``epsf'' Macro.\label{fig:epsf}}
\end{figure*}
%
All these are just trying the illustrate that the bounding boxes
generated by tgif is pretty tight, and there's really no need for
the ``psfile'' construct.  I don't know if there are cases where
some documentation generation software only supports the ``psfile''
construct, but I an putting in the example anyways.

Figure \ref{fig:psfile} is an example of a tgif \LaTeX\,\, figure
printed with the ``psfile'' macro.  Notice the \\rule command.
%
\begin{figure*}[htb]
\special{psfile="an-sr-flip-flop.eps" hoffset=-72 voffset=-792}
\rule{0in}{1.1in}
\caption{Example Tgif Diagram Printed with ``psfile'' Macro.\label{fig:psfile}}
\end{figure*}
%
It is reserving a space of 1.1 inch for the figure.  This can
be figured out from the ruler within tgif.  As a general rule,
the ``psfile'' construct should be avoided.
