@chapter Introduction

This manual describes a portable implementation of KL1 called KLIC,
developed at Institute for New Generation Computer Technology as a part
of the Fifth Generation Computer national project of Japan and its
follow-on project.

KL1 is a concurrent logic programming language based on Guarded Horn
Clauses (GHC, in short).  KL1 has very simple and concise syntax and
semantics and yet provides very powerful features for concurrent
computation.

KLIC compiles KL1 programs to C programs.  A C compiler of the host
system then compiles the C programs to relocatable objects, which will
then be linked together with the runtime library of KLIC
(@pxref{Mechanism of Compilation, , How KLIC Compiler Works}).  Thus,
the system is independent from the hardware architecture of the host
system.  Also, the system is written so that only minimal features of
Unix are used to assure portability.

* Messages::                    Messages to processes
* Argument Modes::              Input/output modes of arguments
@end menu

@node Predicates and Methods, Messages, Description, Description
@subsection Predicates and Methods
@cindex predicate
@cindex method
Unlike other logic programming language systems, KLIC provides two kinds
of procedures, predicates and generic methods.  Predicates define
relations on their arguments and their semantics is fixed.  Generic
methods, (or methods, simply) are defined by @emph{objects} they are
applied to.  Thus, their semantics depends on the object applied.

Sometimes the same operation is provided by both predicates and methods.
For example, obtaining an element of a string can be done by either of
the following two.

@defop {Body Predicate} {builtin} string_element +String +Index @t{-}Element
@defopx {Body Method} string element +String +Index @t{-}Element
@end defop

@noindent
The former is a builtin predicate of the system.  Predicate invocations
are written as follows.

@example
@var{ModuleName}:@var{PredicateName}(@var{Arguments}, @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
In case of the predicate @code{string_element} mentioned above, it is
defined as a builtin predicate and thus no module name is needed in its
invocation.  Thus, an invocation is written as follows.

@example
string_element(@var{String}, @var{Index}, @var{Element})
@end example

@noindent
In general, a module name may come first with a colon before the
predicate name.  Some predicates do not have any arguments.  In such
cases, parentheses enclosing arguments are also omitted.

@cindex class
@cindex generic method
The latter is a generic method defined on the objects of class
@code{string}.  Method invocation is written as follows.

@example
generic:@var{MethodName}(@var{Object}, @var{OtherArguments, @dots{}})
@end example

@noindent
In case of the method @code{element} mentioned above, its invocation is
written as follows.

@example
generic:element(@var{String}, @var{Index}, @var{Element})
@end example

The same operation may be effected using either a predicate or a method.
For example, obtaining the third element (element number 2) of a string
@var{S} into @var{E} can be done by either of the following
invocations.

@example
string_element(S, 2, E)
generic:element(S, 2, E)
@end example

@noindent
Note that, while the predicate @code{string_element} is only for
obtaining an element of a string, a generic method invocation can also
be used to obtain an element of @emph{similar} object.  For example, an
element of a vector (one-dimensional array) can also be obtained by the
same invocation.

@node Messages, Argument Modes, Predicates and Methods, Description
@subsection Messages
@cindex message
@cindex interprocess communication

KL1 programs often consist of many @emph{processes}.  Processes often
communicate one another using @emph{streams}.  Streams are actually
lists of @emph{messages}.  Lists are made of cells called @emph{cons}
cells with two fields @emph{car} and @emph{cdr}, just as in Lisp or
similar languages.  Thus, when used as message streams, the car part of
a cons cell contains the message and the cdr contains the rest of the
stream.

Some standard features of the KLIC system are also provided as processes
with message stream interface.  An example of such message described in
this manual follows.

@defop {Message} {C-like I/O} putc +C
@end defop

@noindent
This means that a message named @code{putc} is accepted as a message to
a C-like I/O process interface stream.  The message has one argument
called @var{C} in this case.

To send a message to a message stream, the variable referring to the
message stream should be instantiated with a cons cell whose car
contains the message and cdr contains the rest of the stream.  Thus,
when @code{S} is a stream to C-like I/O and character with code 10 is to
be output, the following unification should be made.

@example
S = [putc(10)|T]
@end example

@noindent
Here, the variable @code{T} is given the rest of the stream and thus any
following messages to the stream should be sent to this variable.

@node Argument Modes,  , Messages, Description
@subsection Argument Modes
@cindex argument mode
@cindex input argument
@cindex output argument
Arguments of predicates, methods or messages may have specific
input/output mode.  Input arguments are read by invocation of predicates
or methods; the invocation will be suspended if any of the input
arguments are left undefined.  Output arguments are given a value by the
invocation.

In the description of predicates and methods, input arguments are marked
with a @code{+} and output arguments are marked with a @code{-}.  Some
arguments are not either read or given value.  Such arguments are marked
with a @code{?}.

@cindex concurrent logic programming language

KL1 is a programming language for describing concurrent computation
based on Guarded Horn Clauses (GHC, in short).  GHC belongs to a family
of languages called concurrent logic programming languages or
committed-choice logic programming languages.  Languages that belong to
the family are, for example, Concurrent Prolog, Parlog, Fleng, Strand
and Janus.  These languages have simple and concise syntax and semantics
and yet provide very powerful features for concurrent computation.

Here, a very rough and informal description of the KL1 language is
given.  More detailed and accurate specification are planned to be
supplied in future (hopefully).

@section Basic Execution Mechanism
@cindex execution
@cindex guard
@cindex body
@cindex clause

The following is an example of a small KL1 program that defines a part
of quicksort program.

Example 1: Quicksort

@example
:- module quicksort.

sort(X, Y) :- sort(X, Y, []).

sort([], Y, Z) :- Y = Z.
sort([P|X], Y, Z) :-
    partition(P, X, X1, X2),
    sort(X1, Y, [P|Y1]),
    sort(X2, Y1, Z).

partition(_, [], S, L) :-
    S = [],
    L = [].
partition(P, [W|X], S, L) :- W =< P |
    S = [W|S1],
    partition(P, X, S1, L).
partition(P, [W|X], S, L) :- W >= P |
    L = [W|L1],
    partition(P, X, S, L1).
@end example

The first line, @code{:- module quicksort} declares that this program module
will be called @code{quicksort} (@pxref{Modules}).

Execution of a KL1 program is a (possibly parallel) repetitive reduction
of given @dfn{goals} using program @dfn{clauses}.  Each clause has the
following form.

@example
@var{PredicateName}(@var{Argument pattern} @dots{}) :- @var{Guard} | @var{Body}.
@end example

When a goal is to be reduced, clauses for the predicate of the goal will
be inspected.  For clauses with matching argument pattern, their guard
parts are tested.  All the clauses with matching argument pattern and
satisfied guard conditions are candidates to be used in the reduction.
Only one of them, @emph{arbitrarily chosen,} will be used and the
original goal will be replaced by the goals in the body of the clause
chosen.

If no guard condition tests are required, the guard part along with
the vertical bar can be omitted.

@node Predicates, Modules, Basics, Language
@section Predicates
@cindex predicate
@cindex clause

@dfn{Predicates} of KL1 corresponds to subroutines of Fortran or
functions of C.  Predicates are defined by a collection of clauses with
the same predicate name and the same number of arguments in their heads.
Unlike in some other languages, predicates are identified not only by
their names but also by their @dfn{arities} (numbers of arguments).  To
identify predicates with the same name but different arities, the
notation @code{@var{Predicate}/@var{Arity}} is used in this manual.

In the example of the quicksort program, two predicates with the same
name @code{sort}, with 2 and 3 arguments respectively, are defined
(@pxref{Basics, , Basic Execution Mechanism}).  Such predicates are
referred to as @code{sort/2} and @code{sort/3} respectively.

The order of clauses defining a predicate does not affect the meaning.
For example, a predicate for computing maximum of two integer values can
be defined as follows.
@example
max(X, Y, M) :- X >= Y | M = X.
max(X, Y, M) :- X =< Y | M = Y.
@end example
@noindent

Exactly the same predicate can be defined by reversing the order of the
clauses as follows.
@example
max(X, Y, M) :- X =< Y | M = Y.
max(X, Y, M) :- X >= Y | M = X.
@end example

@cindex otherwise
@cindex negation
When a set of clauses are to be used @emph{only when} another set of
clauses are known not to be applicable, the keyword @code{otherwise}
should be put in between the two sets of clauses.  For example, the
above @samp{max} predicate may be defined as follows.
@example
max(X, Y, M) :- X >= Y | M = X.
otherwise.
max(X, Y, M) :- M = Y.
@end example

@noindent
The meaning of the predicate is almost the same except that this version
succeeds after unifying @samp{M} with @samp{Y} even when @samp{X} or
@samp{Y} does not have an integer value, while the two previous versions
will fail.

The @code{otherwise} directive specifies that clauses after the
directive should not be applied unless all the clauses preceding the
directive are known not to be applicable, even with any information
(variable bindings) may become available afterwards.  This feature
should @emph{not} be confounded with the @code{alternatively} directive,
which specifies that clauses preceding the directive should be given
priority to the clauses following (@pxref{Alternatively, , Clause
Preference}).

@node Modules, Goals, Predicates, Language
@section Modules
@cindex module

KL1 provides @dfn{module} structure for dividing large programs into
many modules.  A module consists of one or more predicates.  Definition
of a module starts with a module declaration of the form @code{:- module
@var{Module}.} Clauses defining predicates in the module will follow.
The end of the file or another module declaration ends the definition of
the module.

In the quicksort example, the first line:

@example
:- module quicksort
@end example

@noindent
declares that this program module is called @code{quicksort}
(@pxref{Basics, , Basic Execution Mechanism}).

Predicates defined with the same name and arity but in different modules
are considered to be different predicates.  Thus, when necessary, the
notation @code{@var{Module}:@var{Predicate}/@var{Arity}} is used to
explicitly specify the module name.

@node Goals, Initial Goal, Modules, Language
@section Goals
@cindex goal

A Goal is a unit of execution of KL1.  Goals are associated with a
predicate.  A goal is reduced to zero or more simpler goals by applying
one of the clauses defining the predicate.

Goals are written as:

@example
@var{Predicate}(@var{Arguments}, @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
or simply as the following.

@example
@var{Predicate}
@end example

@noindent
when the predicate has no arguments.

When the predicate is not in the same module, the syntax is either:

@example
@var{Module}:@var{Predicate}(@var{Arguments}, @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
or as the following.

@example
@var{Module}:@var{Predicate}
@end example

For example, a module named @code{main} that uses the quicksort module
might be defined as follows (@pxref{Basics, , Basic Execution
Mechanism}).

Example 2: Module using @code{quicksort}

@example
:- module main.

main :-
    X = [9,2,8,3,6,7,4,1,5],
    builtin:print(X),
    quicksort:sort(X, Y),
    builtin:print(Y).
@end example

@noindent
Here, the body goal @code{quicksort:sort(X, Y)} is associated with the
predicate @code{sort/2} of the module @code{quicksort}.

@node Initial Goal, Generic Objects, Goals, Language
@section Initial Goal
@cindex main
@cindex initial goal

All KLIC programs start from the initial goal @code{main:main}, i.e.,
the predicate @code{main} with no arguments defined in the module
@code{main}.  The example of the module @code{main} (@pxref{Goals}) is
an example of a main program.

Command line arguments are not passed to the initial goal.  Predicates
to access command line arguments are provided separately
(@pxref{Predicate Interface}).

@cindex generic object

@cindex method
@pindex @code{generic} (pseudo module)

@dfn{Generic objects} provide a framework to extend the KL1 language
with new data types and their operations.  There are three kinds of
generic objects, namely, @dfn{data objects}, @dfn{consumer objects} and
@dfn{generator objects}.

Generic objects are created by pseudo-predicates @code{generic:new}.
Generic data objects are similar to usual KL1 data.  Operations on data
objects are defined by their @dfn{generic methods}.  Methods are invoked
by pseudo-predicates @code{generic:@var{Method}}.  Consumer and
generator objects look like variables to normal KL1 programs and
operations on them are implicit by unification.

Many of the standard types of KLIC, vectors and strings, for example,
are actually implemented as generic data objects.  For them, builtin
predicates can also be used as aliases for generic methods.  For
example, @code{set_vector_element(@var{Original}, @var{Index},
@var{NewElement}, @var{New})} means the same as
@code{generic:set_element(@var{Original}, @var{Index}, @var{NewElement},
@var{New})}.

@cindex object creation

Generic objects are created by the following pseudo-predicate.

@example
generic:new(@var{ClassName}, @var{Object}, @var{Args}, @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
@var{ClassName} should be a symbolic atom which names the object class.
By this invocation, a new generic object is created and associated with
@var{Object}.  Parameters for creation can be specified by @var{Args}.
The meaning of @var{Args} depends on each object class.

@node Guard Methods, Body Methods, Creating Objects, Generic Objects
@subsection Guard Methods of Generic Data Objects
@cindex guard method

Clause selection depending on generic data objects can be done by
calling guard methods.  Guard methods have the following format.

@example
generic:@var{Method}(@var{Object}, @var{Input}, @dots{}):@var{Output}:@dots{}
@end example

@code{@var{Input}, @dots{}} specify input arguments.  If any of the
input arguments are left undefined, this invocation will be suspended.
@code{@var{Output}:@dots{}} specify output arguments, which are returned
from the method.  If some concrete value is specified as an
@var{Output}, guard unification of the specified and returned values
will be made.  Some guard methods have no output arguments, in which
case colon and following @var{Output} are omitted.

@node Body Methods,  , Guard Methods, Generic Objects
@subsection Body Methods of Generic Data Objects
@cindex body method

Operations on generic data objects can be done by calling body methods.
Body methods have the following format.

@example
generic:@var{Method}(@var{Object}, @var{Args}, @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
Unlike guard methods, input and output arguments are not syntactically
distinguished.  The method to be called can be determined in runtime.
To do that, an alternative format is provided.

@example
generic:generic(@var{Object}, @var{Functor})
@end example

@noindent
With this format, @var{Functor} should be (or become in runtime) a
functor structure of the format @code{@var{Method}(@var{Args}, @dots{})}.
Invocation will be suspended until @var{Functor} will become
instantiated.

@node Priority, Alternatively, Generic Objects, Language
@section Priority Specification
@cindex priority

Goals have execution priority associated with them.  Execution priority
is specified by a positive integer value.  Goals with larger priority
values are (usually) executed earlier than goals with smaller priority
values.  However, priority specifications are no more than suggestions
and actual implementations may or may not strictly obey them.

Body goals can have execution priority specification in one of the
following formats.

@quotation
        @code{@var{Goal}@@priority(@var{AbsPrio})}@*
        @code{@var{Goal}@@lower_priority(@var{RelPrio})}@*
        @code{@var{Goal}@@lower_priority}@*
@end quotation

@noindent
Here, @var{AbsPrio} and @var{RelPrio} should be a non-negative integer
constant, or a variable which should be instantiated to a non-negative
integer later.  In the current implementation, negative priority values
are interpreted as zero.

With the absolute priority specification, the goal with the
specification will have the priority value specified by @var{AbsPrio}.
With the relative priority specification, the goal will have priority
less than the priority of the parent goal by the amount specified by
@var{RelPrio}.  The specification @code{@var{Goal}@@lower_priority} has
the same effect as @code{@var{Goal}@@lower_priority(1)}.  Goals without
any priority specifications will have the same priority as their
parents.

The highest possible priority is the largest possible integer value,
which depends on host systems (@pxref{Integers, Integer Atoms}).  The
initial goal @code{main:main} has the maximum priority possible for the
host system (@pxref{Initial Goal}).

@node Alternatively, Argument Pair Notation, Priority, Language
@section Clause Preference
@cindex alternatively
@cindex preference of clauses
@cindex clause preference

Predicates of KL1 may have nondeterminacy; more than one clause may be
applicable.  In such cases, preference among clauses may be specified
using the @code{alternatively} directive.

When the keyword @code{alternatively} is put in between two sets of
clauses, clauses preceding it are @emph{preferred} to those following
it.  However, when clauses preceding the @code{alternatively} directive
cannot be applied directly due to lack of information (insufficient
instantiation of variable values), the clauses following it may be
used.  This feature is often useful in controlling speculative
computation depending on progress of computation.

The feature is not be confounded with the @code{otherwise} feature
(@pxref{Predicates}).  For example, consider the following two
predicates.

@example
p(1, Y, R) :- R = a.
alternatively.
p(X, 2, R) :- R = b.

q(1, Y, R) :- R = a.
otherwise.
q(X, 2, R) :- R = b.
@end example

@noindent
When the first argument is still undefined and the second is @code{2},
the predicate @code{p} may return @code{b} to the third argument using
its second clause.  The predicate @code{q} will wait until the value of
the first argument becomes available.  Thus, if the first argument
eventually becomes @code{1}, the predicate @code{q} is guaranteed to
return @code{a}, but the predicate @code{p} may return either @code{a}
or @code{b}.

@node Argument Pair Notation, Inline C Code, Alternatively, Language
@section Shorthand Notation for Argument Pairs
@cindex argument pair
@cindex paired argument

KL1 programs often require passing two arguments as a pair to a
predicate: one as input and the other as output.  KLIC provides a
shorthand notation for such cases.

@node Paired Arguments, Macros for Paired Arguments, Argument Pair Notation, Argument Pair Notation
@subsection Paired Arguments and their Expansion
@cindex paired argument
@cindex argument pair name
@cindex expanded pair

The head and goals in both guard and body parts of a clause can have
argument pairs specified by a single variable name attached to the head
or goals by a hyphen character.  We call such pseudo variable an
@dfn{argument pair name}.  An example is shown here.

@example
p(X,Y)-Pair :- q(X)-Pair, s(Z)-Pair, r(Pair,Y), t(Z)-Pair.
@end example

@noindent
The pseudo-variable @code{Pair} is an argument pair name.  Such a clause
is interpreted the same as the following clause.

@example
p(X,Y,P0,P) :- q(X,P0,P1), s(Z,P1,P2), r(P2,Y), t(Z,P2,P).
@end example

@noindent
Occurrences of argument pair names attached to the head or goals by a
hyphen character are interpreted as a pair of two different variables
added at the end of the argument lists.  In what follows, we call the
two variables generated from an paired argument an @dfn{expanded pair}.

The second of an expanded pair of a goal is the same as the first of the
expanded pair of the next goal with the same argument pair name.  In the
example above, @code{P1} appearing as the third argument of the goal of
@code{q/3} also appears as the second argument of @code{s/3}, as
originally they both have the same argument pair name @code{Pair}.

The first of an expanded pair in the head will be the same as the first
of the expanded pair in the first goal in the clause with the same
argument pair name.  The second of an expanded pair in the head will be
the same as the second of the expanded pair in the last goal with the
same argument pair name.

In the above example, the first of the expanded pair @code{P0} in the
head appears again as the second argument of the first goal calling
@code{q/3}, and @code{P}, the second of the expanded pair in the head,
appears again as the third argument of the last goal of @code{t/3}.

If the argument pair name appears only in the head, two variables of the
expanded pair are unified in the body.  For example, a clause:

@example
p(X)-Y :- q(X).
@end example

@noindent
is expanded into the following.

@example
p(X,Y0,Y) :- Y0=Y, q(X).
@end example

An argument pair name may appear at a usual argument position rather
than being attached to the head or goals, as does the first argument of
the goal for @code{r/2} in the above example.  In such a case, it is
expanded to a single variable.  This variable is the same as the second
of the last expanded pair and is also the same as the first of the next
expanded pair.  Thus, in the above example, @code{Pair} appearing as the
first argument of @code{r/2} is expanded into @code{P2}, which is the
same as the third argument of @code{s/3} and the second argument of
@code{t/3}.

Arbitrarily many argument pair names can be specified for a head or a
goal.  For example, a clause such as:

@example
p-X-Y :- q-X, r-Y, s-Y-X.
@end example

@noindent
is interpreted as follows.

@example
p(X0,X,Y0,Y) :- q(X0,X1), r(Y0,Y1), s(Y1,Y,X1,X).
@end example

Sometimes, specifying normal arguments after some argument pair names is
desirable.  This can be done by connecting them with a plus (@code{+})
character.  For example:

@example
p-X+Y :- q-X+35, r(Y), s+Y-X.
@end example

@noindent
is interpreted as follows.

@example
p(X0,X,Y) :- q(X0,X1,35), r(Y), s(Y,X1,X).
@end example

Note that the expansion rules for paired arguments described above are
position sensitive for goals.  However, this does @emph{not} at all mean
that the execution order of body goals are constrained anyhow.

Also note that the argument pair notation is no more than macro
expansion of clauses.  One predicate may have clauses some of which
written in the argument pair notation and others in the usual notation.

@subsection Macros for Paired Arguments

@cindex message sending

To fascilitate the usage of paired arguments, KLIC provides the
following macros to be used in place of a goal.

@table @t
@item @var{S} <= @var{M}
Expanded to @code{@var{S0} = [@var{M}|@var{S1}]} where @var{S0} and
@var{S1} are expanded pair for the argument pair name @var{S}.

@item @var{M} => @var{S}
Expanded to @code{[@var{M}|@var{S0}] = @var{S1}} where @var{S0} and
@var{S1} are the expanded pair for the argument pair name @var{S}.

@item @var{S} += @var{E}
@item @var{S} -= @var{E}
@item @var{S} *= @var{E}
@item @var{S} /= @var{E}
Expanded to @code{@var{S1} := @var{S0} + @var{E0}} etc, where @var{S0}
and @var{S1} are the expanded pair for the argument pair name @var{S}.

@item @var{S} <== @var{X}
Expanded to @code{@var{S1} = @var{X}}, where @var{S0} and @var{S1} are
the expanded pair for the argument pair name @var{S}.  @var{S0} does not
appear in the expansion; the original value of the paired argument for
@var{S} will be lost, and the next occurrence of @var{S} will mean
@var{X} instead.  This feature is normally used with a non-paired
occurrence of the argument pair name.  For example:

@example
@dots{}, p-S, q(S), S <== X, r-S, @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
means the following.

@example
@dots{}, p(S0,S1), q(S1), S2 = X, r(S2,S3), @dots{}

Here, the paired argument @code{Acc} plays the role of an accumulator.

At the top of a source file, strings to be inserted in the object C
program can be specified in the following way.

@example
:- inline:"@var{C Program Text to be Inserted}".
@end example

The specified text is inserted in the object C program after standard
declarations and before any user-defined modules.

There can be any number of such inline specification.  A typical
example is as follows.

@example
:- inline:"#include <stdio.h>"
@end example

As inserted C programs are written as string constants of KLIC,
doubleqoute characters have to be escaped with a backslash character.  A
typical example is as follows.

@example
:- inline:"#include \"myheader.h\""
@end example

It might also be a good idea to define macros and functions here, that
are invoked from the inline code in clause guards.

@node Guard Insertion, C-Level Rep, Top Insertion, Inline C Code
@subsection Inline Insertion in the Guard

Inline insertion specification can also appear as a guard goal with
one of the following forms.

@example
inline:"@var{C Program Text}"
inline:"@var{C Program Text}":[@var{ArgSpec}, @dots{}]
@end example

With either format, the C program text is literally inserted in the
object code corresponding to the guard part, except that percent signs
(@code{%}) in the program text string specify special formatting.  The
following table lists special format characters after percent signs and
what they mean.

@table @t
@item @key{digit}
The name of the C variable corresponding to the @key{digit}-th
@var{ArgSpec} (zero origin).  Note that only up to 10 such arguments are
allowed.

@item f
The name of the C label to @code{goto} when this clause should fail or
suspend.

@item %
The percent character itself, i.e., percent characters should be
doubled.  Be careful when you specify format strings for @code{printf}.
@end table

@noindent
@var{ArgSpec } has one of the following formats.

@table @t
@item @var{Variable}+@var{Type}
Specifies that the value of the variable is used within the inserted
program text.  Object code for synchronization with availability of the
variable value and checking of the value type is generated by the
compiler.

@item @var{Variable}-@var{Type}
Specifies that variable is given a value within the inserted program
text.  This has to be the first occurence of the variable.  The compiler
assumes that, after executing the inserted code, the variable will have
value of @var{Type}.
@end table

@noindent
The Type field should be one of the following.

@table @t
@item any
Anything, including uninstantiated variables
@item bound
Any bound value
@item atomic
An atomic value (a symbolic atom or an integer)
@item int
An integer
@item atom
An symbolic atom
@item list
A list structure
@item functor
A functor structure (including generic object)
@item object
A generic data object
@item object(@var{Class})
A generic data object of @var{Class}
@end table

Values are referenced without any indirections for all types except for
@code{any}.  For an input (@code{+}) mode argument, the generated code
makes sure that, before executing the inserted program text, the
argument will have the value of the specified type directly, without
indirect references.  For an output (@code{-}) mode argument, the
compiler assumes that, after executing the inserted program text, the
variable will have the value of the specified type directly, without any
indirect references, and uses that information for optimization.  If you
cannot be sure of this for output mode arguments, specify @code{any},
which may be less efficient but safe.

@node C-Level Rep, Examples of Inline, Guard Insertion, Inline C Code
@subsection C-Level Representation of KL1 Terms

Note that C language types of the C variables and KL1 language types of
corresponding KL1 values are not the same.  All the C variables
corresponding to a KL1 value have the type @code{q} which means almost
nothing except that it occupies a single word.  KL1 values are somehow
encoded (with attached tag etc).  For example, an integer 3 of KL1 is
@emph{not} represented by the bit pattern corresponding to integer 3 in
of the language C.

This document is not intended to describe all the details of the data
representation scheme of KLIC.  Such description and programs depending
on it will be obsoleted anyway by future revisions of the KLIC system.
However, manipulation of integer values may be the easiest and useful in
most C programs written inline.  Thus, we'll describe macros for data
conversion for integers.  They are unlikely to be changed in future
versions.

To obtain the integer value of a variable corresponding to an integer
value of KL1, use the macro @code{intval(@var{X})}.  To obtain KL1
representation of integer in C, use the macro @code{makeint(@var{N})}.

@node Hints of Inline,  , Examples of Inline, Inline C Code
@subsection Some Hints on Using the Inline C Code Feature

@itemize @bullet
@item
Whenever possible, avoid using the inline feature.  Revisions of the
KLIC system may obsolete your code.

@item
If multiple lines are to be inserted consecutively, specify all of them
in one single inline specification.  Otherwise, they might be
interleaved by other code for the guard.  Newlines are allowed within
the inserted program text.

@item
Do not forget to prefix doublequotes and backslahes with a backslash.
Do not forget also to write two percent signs to insert one.
If you would like to say hello to the world, you should write such a
program as follows.

@example
hello :-
    inline:"printf(\"Hello, world\\n\");" |
    @dots{}
@end example

Note the backslashes before doublequotes within the inlined code and
doubled backslash before @code{n}.  If you put only one backslash before
@code{n}, it will become a newline code after inline expansion; it will
appear within a string constant in the expanded C program.  It
fortunately works the same in this case, except that some C compilers
may generate a warning message.

@item
If your program with inline code does not work as you expect it to, the
best way to find the problem may be to look into the C code generated.

already has some defined value, the value of @var{Y} is given to
@var{X}.  If @var{Y} has no value and @var{X} has some, the reverse
takes place.  If both do not have values yet, two variables are made to
mean the same variable.  If both have values, they are matched.  If both
are the data structures of the same kind, this unification operation is
made recursively to corresponding elements of two structures.

@cindex standard order
@cindex comparison
@cindex hashing
@defop {Guard Predicate} {builtin} compare +X +Y @t{-}R
Compares @var{X} and @var{Y}, and returns the result in @var{R}.  The
result is an integer value less than, equal to, or greater than 0,
when @var{X} is less than, equal to, or greater than @var{Y},
respectively.

The comparison is made by the standard order.  This predicate can
compare data of any types.  If both @var{X} and @var{Y} are of the same
numeric type, normal numerical comparison is made.  Note that integer
and floating point numbers are @emph{not} of the same type; their
comparison may not be meaningful.  Two strings are compared in
(so-called) dictionary order.

The order of any two data of different types is somehow defined by the
system.  However, the ordering is guaranteed to be kept only within a
single executable program.  If some data sequence is saved into a
permanent file using the ordering provided by this predicate, the same
program recompiled or linked with some other programs may or may not
recognize the sequence as ordered.  Different programs, of course, may
use different ordering.

Both @var{X} and @var{Y} have to be instantiated enough for making the
comparison.  For example @samp{f(V) @@< f(W)} will suspend if not both
@samp{V} and @samp{W} are instantiated.  On the other hand, @samp{f(1,V)
@@< f(2,W)} will succeed immediately, as the order can be determined
without looking into values of @samp{V} or @samp{W}.

The absolute value of the result @var{R} may have some meaning for
certain data types.  When comparing two strings, the absolute value of
the result is one more than the index of the first differng element (a
la @code{strcmp} of C).

Some generic objects may not implement their comparison methods, and, in
such cases, their comparison will result in a fatal error.

@defopx {Guard Predicate} {builtin} @@=< +X +Y
@defopx {Guard Predicate} {builtin} @@>= +X +Y

Compares @var{X} and @var{Y} with the standard order.  If the condition

@end defop

@defop {Guard Predicate} {builtin} \= +X +Y
@cindex principal functor
Compares @var{X} and @var{Y} and succeeds if and only if their principal
functors are different.  For atomic values, it means that they are
different; for functor structures, it means that either they have
different functor names or different arity.  For generic objects, the
predicate succeeds when two objects are of different classes.

Note that @samp{f(a) \= f(b)} fails, as the two terms have the same
principal functor.  Note also that, floating point numbers are generic
objects and thus @samp{X \= Y} fails for any two floating point numbers,
as they are objects of the same class.
@end defop

@defop {Guard Predicate} {builtin} hash +X @t{-}H
Computes the hash value of @var{X} and returns it in @var{H}.  The hash
value is a non-negative integer value.

@var{X} has to be instantiated enough to compute hash value.  Some
generic objects may not implement hash methods, and, in such cases,
their hash value becomes a constant.

On a parallel implementation, the predicate returns the processor number
executing the predicate in @var{Node} and the total number of (pseudo-)
processors available in @var{NumNodes}.  Processor numbers have zero
origin.  Thus, the maximum value returned to @var{Node} is one less than

@defop {Body Predicate} {builtin} unbound ?X @t{-}Result
Checks whether @var{X} is already bound to some concrete value or not
and returns the @var{Result}.

If the toplevel of @var{X} is already defined, @var{Result} is unified
with a single-element vector of the form @{@var{X}@}.  When @var{X} is
bound to a structured value, its elements may or may not be bound
yet.

If @var{X} is not bound yet, @var{Result} is unified with a three
element vector of the form @{@var{Addr1}, @var{Addr2}, @var{X}@}, where
@var{Addr1} and @var{Addr2} are integers indicating the current address
of the variable @var{X} somehow.  Note that variable addresses may
change in time by garbage collection, automatic data migration in
parallel implementations or any such low level implementational reasons;
they are no more than debugging hints.

@strong{Do not use this predicate in normal application programs.}
Unlike the @code{var/1} feature of sequential Prolog, variables once
judged as unbound can be bound in the next instance on parallel
implementations.  Thus, usage of this predicate should be restricted to
programs that have to go into low level details of the system
implementation, such as debugging tools.

@section Atomic Data
@cindex atomic data

KLIC provides two kinds of atomic data types, numerical and symbolic.

For numerical data, KLIC provides integer and floating point number data
types and operations to manipulate them.  Floating point numbers are
implemented as generic objects and thus actually are not an atom.

Note that implicit type conversions between integer and floating point
data are never made.  Integer numbers and floating point numbers are
treated completely separately.

Whether given data is atomic or not can be tested by the following guard
predicates.

@defop {Guard Predicate} {builtin} atomic +X
Tests whether @var{X} is atomic or not.  Floating point numbers are
@emph{not} judged as atomic by this predicate.

@node Notation of Atoms, Symbolic Atom Operation, Symbolic Atoms, Symbolic Atoms
@subsubsection Notation of Symbolic Atoms

The notation of symbolic atoms is similar to Edinburgh Prolog, which is
one of the following.

@itemize @bullet
@item
A lower case letter followed by a sequence of any number (including
zero) of letters, digits or underlines.

Examples:
@example
icot   kl1   a_symbolic_atom_with_a_long_name
@end example

@item
A sequence of special characters (some of @code{~}, @code{+},
@code{-}, @code{*}, @code{/}, @code{\}, @code{^},
@code{<}, @code{>}, @code{=}, @code{`} (backquote),
@code{:}, @code{.}, @code{?}, @code{@@}, @code{#},
@code{$}, @code{&}).

Examples:
@example
+   >=   :-   =:=
@end example

@item
A sequence of any characters quoted by single quotes.  If single quote
characters are to be included, they should be doubled or escaped by a
backslash.

Examples:
@example
'Hello world'    'an atom with \'singlequotes\' in it'
@end example

@item
Special one-character atoms.  There are three of them, which are
@code{!}, @code{|} and @code{;}.  Also, @code{|} has a special meaning
in list notation (@xref{Notation of Lists}).

@item
A special atom @code{[]}, which usually is used to represent ends of
lists (@pxref{Lists}).  Spaces can be in between @code{[} and @code{]}.
@end itemize

Important differences with Edinburgh Prolog syntax are the following.

@itemize @bullet
@item
A vertical bar (@code{|}) means a one-character atom.  Even when it is
used as an operator, it is @emph{not} treated the same as a semicolon
(@code{;}) but as a different atom.

@item
A pair of curly braces (@code{@{@}}) does not stand for a symbolic atom.
It means a vector with no elements (@pxref{Notation of Vectors}).
@end itemize

@node Symbolic Atom Operation,  , Notation of Atoms, Symbolic Atoms
@subsubsection Operations on Symbolic Atoms

Whether a given data object is a symbolic atom or not can be tested by
the following guard predicate.

@defop {Guard Predicate} {builtin} atom +X
Tests whether @var{X} is a symbolic atom or not.
@end defop

To maintain the uniqueness of atoms, the system gives a unique number
to each atom and maintains the association between atom name strings and
atom numbers.  Association of symbolic atoms and their names can be
known by the following predicates defined in the module
@code{atom_table}.
@pindex @code{atom_table}

@defop {Predicate} {atom_table} make_atom +String @t{-}Atom
When given a @var{String}, returns @var{Atom} with that name.  If such
an atom does not exist, a new atom is registered.
@end defop

@defop {Predicate} {atom_table} atom_number +Atom @t{-}Number
Internal serial number for @var{Atom} is returned to @var{Number} as an
integer value.
@end defop

@defop {Predicate} {atom_table} get_atom_string +Atom @t{-}String
The name string of @var{Atom} is returned to @var{String}.
@end defop

@defop {Predicate} {atom_table} intern +String @t{-}Result
The same as atom_table:make_atom, except that the returned value is a
functor structure of the form @code{normal(@var{Atom})}.
@end defop

@defop {Predicate} {atom_table} get_atom_name +Atom @t{-}Result
The same as atom_table:get_atom_string, except that the returned value
is a functor structure of the form @code{normal(@var{String})}.
@end defop

Although symbolic atoms are associated with their name strings, do
@emph{not} use them for string manipulation.  String data objects
provide much more functionality and better performance
(@pxref{Strings}).

KLIC provides several ways to denote integer constants.
@itemize @bullet
@item
Usual decimal notation: optional minus sign followed by a sequence of
decimal digits.  Examples: @samp{123}, @samp{-35}.
@item
Based notation: optional minus sign followed by a sequence of decimal
digits specifying the base (1 to 36), an apostrophe, and then a sequence
of digits of the base, that are digits and alphabets (case insensitive).
Examples: @samp{2'1010}, @samp{16'0D0a}.  Value of an integer with base
1 is the number of ones in the digit sequence; for example
@samp{1'10110} means 3.
@item
@cindex character code
Character code notation: optional minus sign followed by a digit 0, an
apostrophe and a character.  Examples: @samp{0'a} means the character
code of lowercase letter @kbd{a}.
@end itemize
The above listed constant notations can be used in both KL1 programs and
KL1 data read in by Prolog-like I/O interface (@pxref{Prolog I/O, ,

The following are also allowed in KL1 programs for compatility with
PIMOS system on PIM machines.
@itemize @bullet
@item
Based notation: optional minus sign followed by a sequence of decimal
digits specifying the base (1 to 36), a sharp sign, and then a charcter
string of digits of the base, that are digits and alphabets (case
insensitive), surrounded by doublequotes.  Examples: @samp{2#"1010"},
@samp{16#"0D0a"}.

@subsection Lists
@tindex list
@cindex list
@cindex cons cell
@cindex car
@cindex cdr
@cindex nil

Lists are arbitrarily long sequences of any data objects.  In KL1, List
structures are made up of functor structures @code{./2}, that is,
functor structures with their name @code{.} and arity two.  List
structures are composed of possibly many of these functor structures
(sometimes called @dfn{cons cells}).

The first element of the cons cell, sometimes called the @dfn{car} of
the cell, represents the first element of the list.  The second element,
the @dfn{cdr} of the cell, represents the rest of the list.  Termination
of the list is indicated by a symbolic atom @code{[]} being the cdr.

Whether a given argument is a list or not can be tested by the following
guard predicate.

@defop {Guard Predicate} {builtin} list +X
Tests whether @var{X} is a cons cell.  Note that, despite its name, this
predicate fails for a null list @code{[]} for a historical reason.
@end defop

Incrementally instantiated list structures are conveniently used as
message streams.

@node Notation of Lists, Merging, Lists, Lists
@subsubsection Notation of Lists
@cindex notation of lists

As in Lisp, lists of KL1 are constructed using @emph{cons} data
structures, which is actually a functor structure @code{./2}.

The basic notation for lists is @code{[@var{Car} | @var{Cdr}]}, which
consists of the first element @var{Car} and the tail of the list
@var{Cdr}.  This means exactly the same as @code{.(@var{Car},
@var{Cdr})}.  An empty list is represented by an atom @code{[]}.

If @var{Cdr} happens to be empty, that is, when the list consists only
of one element @var{Car}, such a list can be written as
@code{.(@var{Car}, [])} or @code{[@var{Car} | []]}, or, alternatively,
as @code{[@var{Car}]}.  That is, the sequence @code{| []} at the tail of
a list can be ommitted.

Lists with its car being @var{Car} and its cdr being a list
@code{[@var{Cadr}, @dots{}]} is @code{[@var{Car} | [@var{Cadr},
@dots{}]]}, which can be abbreviated as @code{[@var{Car}, @var{Cadr},
@dots{}]}.  For example, a list consisting of four elements, @code{first},
@code{second}, @code{third} and @code{fourth} can be written as @code{[first,
second, third, fourth]}.

A list consisting of four or more elements, but with the first four
elements being @code{first}, @code{second}, @code{third} and
@code{fourth}, can be written as @code{[first, second, third, fourth |
Rest]}.  Here, the variable @code{Rest} corresponds to the list
beginning with the fifth element, or an empty list if the whole list
had only four elements.

Note that, unlike in Ediburgh Prolog, the character sequence @code{,..}
can @emph{not} be used in place of @code{|}.

@node Merging,  , Notation of Lists, Lists
@subsubsection Manipulation of Message Streams
@cindex stream
@cindex message stream
@cindex merging

A stream merger is a process that takes multiple message streams
represented as lists of messages as input, and passes all the messages
from all the input streams to a single output stream also represented as
a list.

The output consists of all the messages in the inputs with duplicates
preserved.  When two messages are ordered in one of the input streams,
their order is also preserved in the output.  When messages are from
different input streams, their order in the output is unpredictable.
The order may differ in one execution of the same program from
another.  The behavior of mergers is thus nondeterministic.

For example, when there are two input streams @code{[1, 2, 3]} and
@code{[a, b, c]}, the output can be something like @code{[1, 2, a, b, 3,
c]} or @code{[1, a, 2, b, c, 3]}, but will never be @code{[1, a, 3, b,
c, 2]}.

A binary (two-input) stream merger can be defined in KL1 as follows.

@example
merge([M|In1], In2, Out) :- Out=[M|OutT],  merge(In1, In2, OutT).
merge(In1, [M|In2], Out) :- Out=[M|OutT],  merge(In1, In2, OutT).
merge([], In2, Out) :- Out=In2.
merge(In1, [], Out) :- Out=In1.
@end example

@itemize @bullet
@item
The first clause forwards one message coming from the first input stream
to the output stream.  The first input stream is the first argument and
the output stream is the third argument of the predicate.  It then calls
the predicate @code{merge/3} recursively for repetitive execution.

@item
The second clause does the same for the second input stream.

@item
The third clause is used when the first input stream has no more messages
in it.  In this case, the second input stream is directly connected to
the output.  As there are no more messages to merge from the first input
stream, the result of the merging should be the same as the second input
stream.

@item
The fourth clause provides the corresponding feature when the second
input stream has no more messages in it.
@end itemize

When messages come from both the first and the second at the same time,
either the first or the second clause is arbitrarily chosen.  This is the
source of the nondeterminacy of the merger.

Although binary mergers are easy to define in KL1, defining a merger
with arbitrarily many input streams is not so easy.  It is also
desirable to add new input streams dynamically, which makes it still
harder.  Also, mergers are used quite frequently in KL1 programs and
thus should be quite efficient.  Thus, the KLIC system provides a merger
as one of its standard feature.

A new merger can be created by the following pseudo-predicate.

@defop {Object Creation} merge new ?Input ?Output
@tindex merger
A new merger with single input stream is created.  Its input stream is
@var{Input} and its output is @var{Output}.
@end defop

The merger process created by the above pseudo-predicate does not
actually start any merging immediately after its creation.  It only
forwards the messages from @var{Input} to @var{Output}, without changing
the order.

To add a new input stream to a merger, unify the input with a vector
whose elements are input streams.  For example, if you need a binary
merger, do the following.

@example
generic:new(merge, @var{Input}, @var{Output}),
@var{Input} = @{@var{In1}, @var{In2}@}
@end example

This means the same as the following.

@example
generic:new(merge, @{@var{In1}, @var{In2}@}, @var{Output})
@end example

After doing the above, the merger will merge messages from two input
streams, @var{In1} and @var{In2}, to the output stream @var{Output}.

Input streams to a merger can be added not only immediately after its
creation but at any time on demand.  Two more input streams are added,
for example, by the following.

@example
@var{In2} = @{@var{In2A}, @var{In2B}, @var{In2C}@}
@end example

After this, the merger will have four input streams, @var{In1},
@var{In2A}, @var{In2B} and @var{In2C}.

When one of the input streams is no longer needed, that input stream
can be simply closed, by unifying it with an atom @code{[]}.

The size of the vector unified with an input stream can be arbitrarily
large or small.  When it has only one element, the number of input
streams will not be changed.  When the vector has no elements,
unifying with it has the same effect as closing the stream.

The output stream will be closed, i.e., the tail of the output list is
unified with @code{[]}, when all the input streams have been closed.

Here are some clues in using the merger.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Messages merged can be a data structure containing unbound variables.
Such messages are sometimes called @dfn{incomplete messages}.
Incomplete messages are convenient for constructing a server-client
process structure.  Giving values to variables in messages can be used
for communicating backwards from the server to the client.

@item
Merging may look deterministic on sequential implementations.  Do never
rely on it.  It will become really nondeterministic on parallel
implementations.
@end itemize

@node Vectors, Strings, Lists, Structured Data

Vectors are fixed-length one-dimensional array of KL1 data.  The length
of a vector is determined on its creation.  Elements can be any KL1 data

Elements are indexed by an integer beginning from 0.  For example, a
vector with 3 elements has elements numbered 0, 1 and 2.

@subsubsection Creating New Vectors
@cindex creation of vectors

In addition to the notation described above, vectors can be dynamically
created during program execution.  The following predicate can be used
to create a new vector.

@defop {Object Creation} vector new @t{-}Vector +Init
@defopx {Body Predicate} {builtin} new_vector @t{-}Vector +Init
A new vector is created and returned to @var{Vector}.

If the argument @var{Init} is an integer, it sepcifies the number of
elements.  The elements are initialized with integer @code{0} in this
case.  For example, @samp{generic:new(vector, V, 2)} creates a vector
@samp{@{0, 0@}} and returned it to @code{V}.

If @var{Init} is a list, the newly created vector is initiated by the
elements of the list.  Naturally, the number of elements of the vector
becomes the same as the length of the list.  For example,
@samp{generic:new(vector, V, [a, b, c])} creates a vector @code{@{a, b,
c@}} and unifies it with @code{V}.

@var{At} has to be a non-negative integer less than or equal to the size
of the original vector.  @var{Lower} will have elements with indices
between 0 and @code{@var{At}-1}, inclusive.  Elements with indices
between @var{At} and up will be included in @var{Upper}.

@subsubsection Notation of Strings

In KLIC, character string constants should be denoted by sequence of
characters surrounded by a pair of doublequotes, as follows.

@example
"A string of the characters written here"
@end example

The following escape sequences (a la ANSI C) are used to specify
doublequotes, backslashes and control codes as string elements.

@table @code
@item \a
Bell.
@item \b
Backspace.
@item \t
Tab.
@item \n
Newline.
@item \v
Vertical tab.
@item \f
Formfeed.
@item \r
Carriage return.
@item \'
Singlequote.
@item \"
Doublequote.
@item \?
Question mark.
@item \\
Backslash.  Two consecutive backslach characters specifies a single
backslash in the string.
@item \@i{ooo}
Code specified by the octal number @i{ooo}.  Up to three octal digits
are recognized.
@item \x@i{hh}
Code specified by the hexadecimal number @i{hh}.  Arbitrarily many
hexadecimal digits may be used.
@item \@key{newline}
The backslash character along with the newline code immediately
following it are ignored.  This sequence results in no characters at all
in the string.
@end table

@noindent
Example:

@example
"The character \'\"\' (doublequote)"
@end example

@noindent
The above example is understood as a string containing the following
characters.

@example
The character '"' (doublequote)
@end example

Strings should not contain newlines nor doublequotes directly.  A
standard way for including newlines within a string is to end the line
with @samp{\n\}.  By this, a new line code is inserted by the sequence
@samp{\n} and the actual newline in the source code following the second
@samp{\} is ignored.

Unlike in Edinburgh Prolog, character strings are @emph{not} lists of
character codes.

@node Creating Strings, Predicates on Strings, Notation of Strings, Strings
@subsubsection Creating New Strings

In addition to the constant strings described above, strings can be
dynamically created during execution.  The following predicate can be
used to create a new string.

@defop {Object Creation} string new @t{-}String +Init +ElemSize
@defopx {Body Predicate} {builtin} new_string @t{-}String +Init +ElemSize
A new string is created and unified with @var{String}.  The last
argument @var{ElemSize} specifies the bit width of the elements.  As
only 8-bit strings are available in the current version, this should be
8.

When the argument @var{Init} is an integer, it sepcifies the number of
elements.  In this case, the elements are initialized with integer
@code{0} (null code).  For example, @samp{generic:new(string, S, 3, 8)}
creates @samp{"\0\0\0"}.

If @var{Init} is a list of integers, the newly created string is
initiated by the elements of the list.  Naturally, the number of
elements of the string becomes the same as the length of the list.  In
this case, list elements should have values that fits in the given bit
width; between 0 and 255 in case of 8-bit strings.  For example,
@samp{generic:new(string, S, [0'a, 0'b, 0'c], 8)} creates @samp{"abc"}.

unix:cd("a", 0),
unix:cd("b", 0),
unix:system("mkdir ls", 0)
@end example

@noindent
may list the directory @code{a} but may possibly list @code{b} or even
some other directory before doing any @code{cd}, depending on the
execution order.  On the other hand:

@example
unix:unix([cd("a", 0),
           cd("b", 0),
           system("ls", 0)])
@end example

@noindent
will surely try two @code{cd} and @code{ls} in this order, as what
decides the order is not the order of execution but the order of the
elements in a list structure.

On parallel implementations, KLIC consists of multiple processes.  The
process in which the unix stream is obtained will be the process
where all the messages are handled.  For example, @code{cd(Path)}
message will change working directory of that single process and none of
others.

If you obtain two or more message streams, there will be no automatic
synchronization between messages sent to different streams.

@subsection Opening Streams for Input and Output Operations

The following messages to the Unix stream open a Unix I/O stream.
Messages to be sent to the resulting Unix I/O streams (@emph{not} the
Unix stream stream itself) for actually performing I/O are described in
separate places: @xref{C-like I/O, , Input and Output with C-like
Interface}, and @ref{Prolog I/O, , Input and Output with Prolog-like
Interface}.

The following is a KLIC program for saying hello to the world.

@example
main :- unix:unix([stdout(R)]), check_and_write(R).

check_and_write(normal(R)) :- R = [fwrite("hello world\n")].
@end example

@defop {Message} {unix stream} stdin @t{-}Result
@defopx {Message} {unix stream} stdout @t{-}Result
@defopx {Message} {unix stream} stderr @t{-}Result
@cindex standard input
@cindex standard output
@cindex standard input
@cindex stdio
These messages open a stream associated with process's standard input,
standard output and standard error file respectively, and return
@code{normal(@var{Stream})} to @var{Result}.
@end defop

@defop {Message} {unix stream} read_open +Path @t{-}Result
@defopx {Message} {unix stream} write_open +Path @t{-}Result
@defopx {Message} {unix stream} append_open +Path @t{-}Result
@defopx {Message} {unix stream} update_open +Path @t{-}Result
@cindex open
These messages open the file named by the string @var{Path}, and return
@code{normal(@var{Stream})} to @var{Result}.  The opening mode is input,
output, append or input/output, respectively.  If opening of the file
fails, @code{abnormal} is returned instead.
@end defop

@node Sockets, Files & Dirs, I/O Opening, Unix
@subsection Using Sockets

Unix- and Internet-protocol sockets can be obtained using the following
messages to the Unix stream.  Only sockets of SOCK_STREAM type are
provided.

@defop {Message} {unix stream} connect +Spec @t{-}Result
Creates a socket and connects it to socket specified by @var{Spec} and
returns @code{normal(@var{Stream})} to @var{Result}.  @var{Spec} should
have either of the following formats.

@table @t
@item unix(@var{Path})
A unix domain socket with the pathname @var{Path}is opened.
@item inet(@var{HostName}, @var{Port})
An internet domain socket of the host specified by a string
@var{HostName} and port number @var{Port} is opened.
@item inet(@{@var{B1}, @var{B2}, @var{B3}, @var{B4}@}, @var{Port})
An internet domain socket is opened.  The host is specified by the
internet address @var{B1} through @var{B4} is opened.
@end table
The obtained stream handles both input and output messages.
@end defop

@defop {Message} {unix stream} bind +Spec @t{-}Result
Creates a socket and binds it to a name specified by @var{Spec}.  The
format of @var{Spec} is the same for the message @code{connect}
@emph{except} that @var{HostName} should be omitted for internet domain
sockets.  What is returned to @var{Result} is
@code{normal(@var{Stream})} but this @var{Stream} is a bound socket
stream and does not directly handle I/O messages.  Rather, it expects
@code{accept} messages to obtain I/O message streams.
When the bound socket stream obtained is closed and the socket type is
@code{unix}, the named socket specified by @var{Path} in @var{Spec} will
be unlinked.
@end defop

@defop {Message} {bound socket} accept @t{-}Result
Accepts a connection to the socket and returns
@code{normal(@var{Stream})} to @var{Result}, where @var{Stream} is an
I/O message stream for both input and output messages.
@end defop

@cindex asynchronous I/O
Sockets provide asynchronous I/O, that is, waiting for a connection or
acceptance of a connection will not block other processes in the KLIC
system.  Trying to read or write to sockets with buffers empty or full
respectively will not block the whole computation.  Such I/O operations
will be postponed until immediate operations become possible.

@strong{Limitations:} When an operation on a socket is postponed, all
the remaining operations to be done on the socket are also postponed
until the completion of the postponed operation.  This is problematic
when both input and output has to be polled.  The problem is planned to
be solved in a future release.

@cindex Linux
@strong{Limitations on Linux:}Asynchronous I/O operations do not work on
Linux (at least with Slackware 1.2.0) with the current version.

Corresponds to @code{unlink} system call.
@end defop

@defop {Message} {unix stream} mktemp +Template @t{-}Filename
Makes a unique file name from the given @var{Template} and returns it to
@var{Filename}.  Corresponds to the C library routine @code{mktemp}.
Unlike the library routine, the template does @emph{not} have to have
six trailing @code{X} characters.  If a unique file name cannot be
created somehow, a null string is returned to @var{Filename}.
@end defop

@defop {Message} {unix stream} access +Path +Mode @t{-}Result
Checks accessibility of the file with pathname @var{Path} with the mode
@var{Mode} is validate, and returns the result to @var{Result}.
Corresponds to the C library routine @code{access}.  If the file is
accessible, @code{0} is returned; otherwise, @code{-1} is returned.
@var{Mode} is an integer, with the bits of the following meaning.

@table @t
@item 4
read permission
@item 2
write permission
@item 1
execute permission
@item 0
test existence
@end table
@end defop

@defop {Message} {unix stream} chmod +Path +Mode @t{-}Result
Changes the permission mode of the file with pathname @var{Path} to
@var{Mode}.  Corresponds to the system call @code{chmod}.  If changing
the mode is successful, @code{0} is returned to @var{Result}; otherwise,
@code{-1} is returned.  @var{Mode} is an integer with standard Unix
permission bits.
@end defop

@defop {Message} {unix stream} umask @t{-}OldMask
@defopx {Message} {unix stream} umask @t{-}OldMask +NewMask
Returns the current file creation mask to @var{OldMask}.  With two
arguments, sets the file creation mask to @var{NewMask}.  Corresponds to
the @code{umask} system call.
@end defop

@node Signals, Misc Unix Messages, Files & Dirs, Unix
@subsection Handling Signal Interrupts
@cindex signal
@cindex interrupt

Unix signals can be converted to a list of integers using the following
message to the unix stream.

@defop {Message} {unix stream} signal_stream +Signal @t{-}Result
Unix signals specified by @var{Signal} (an integer value) will become
caught and reported.  The argument @var{Result} will become
@code{normal(Stream)} and whenever a signal of the specified kind is
detected, that signal number is sent to Stream.  For example, if signal
2 (SIGINT in BSD and SVR4, at least) is detected, Stream becomes
@code{[2|@var{Rest}]}.  Further signals are reported to @var{Rest}.
@end defop

failure to @var{Result}.
@end defop

@defop {Message} {unix stream} fork @t{-}Pid
Forks a new process which is a copy of the current process.  Corresponds
to the @code{fork} system call.  If a child process is successfully
created, the process ID of the child process is returned to @var{Pid} in
the parent process, and @code{0} is returned in the child process.
@end defop

@defop {Message} {unix stream} fork_with_pipes @t{-}Result
Creates pipes and fork a new process.  The new process is a copy of the

KLIC provides two different sets of I/O operations.  One is similar to

available from Prolog language.

C-like features are in a lower level and provide better performance both

phases, the Prolog-like higher-level interface, allowing I/O of data
structures directly, might be beneficial.

Changes the position of the stream according to the offset and pointer
name given as @var{Offset} and @var{Ptrname}, respectively.  The offset
is specified as a signed integer by @var{Offset}.  When @var{Ptrname} is
0, the offset is from the beginning of the file; when 1, from the
current position; when 2, from the end of file.  If successful, @code{0}
is returned @var{Result}; otherwise @code{-1}.

Note that, due to the range restriction of integer values, this message
may not be able to move to arbitrary positions in a very large file
(larger than 128MB, on systems with 32-bit long integers).
@end defop

@defop {Message} {C-like I/O} ftell @t{-}Result

instantiation of the variable @var{X}, and then outputs the value in a
Prolog-like format followed by a period and a newline.

@item variable(@var{VarName})
a variable with its name string @var{VarName}
@item atom(@var{Atom})
a symbolic atom @var{Atom}
@item integer(@var{Int})
an integer @var{Int}
@item floating_point(@var{Float})
a floating point number @var{Float}
@item list([@var{Car}|@var{Cdr}])
a cons cell consisting of @var{Car} and @var{Cdr}, which are wrapped
terms recursively
@item functor(@var{Functor}(@var{Arg}, @dots{})
a functor structure; its arguments (@var{Arg}, etc) are wrapped terms
recursively
@item vector(@{@var{Elem}, @dots{}@})
a vector; its elements (@var{Elem}, etc) are wrapped terms recursively
@item string(@var{Str})
a string @var{Str}
@item unknown(@var{Term})
some unknown data; wrapping may be inprecise in this case
@end table

For example, the wrapped representation of a term:

@example
f(a, X, @{3, ["abc"|X]@}, 3.14)
@end example

@noindent
is the following.

@example
functor(f(atom(a),
        variable("X"),
        vector(@{integer(3), list([string("abc")|variable("X")])@}),
        floating_point(3.14))).
@end example

The following predicate convert wrapped terms to normal terms.

@defop {Predicate} {variable} unwrap -Wrapped ?Term
Converts a wrapped term @var{Wrapped} to a normal term @var{Term}.
@end defop

Wrapped terms are normally obtained as a result of input operations
(@pxref{Input Msgs (Prolog style), , Input Messages with Prolog-like
Interface}).  Wrapped terms can also be constructed by usual user
programs, as they are nothing more than a usual KL1 term.  The following
predicate that converts normal terms to wrapped terms may also be useful
in certain cases.

@defop {Predicate} {variable} wrap ?Term -Wrapped
Converts a normal term @var{Term} to a wrapped term @var{Wrapped}.

In the current version, all variables are given the same name @code{_}.
Thus, by wrapping a term and then unwrapping its result, all the
variables in the original term will become references to the same
variable.  This is a bug and is planned to be fixed in a future version.

When @var{Term} contains multiple references of a same variable,
computation on-going concurrently may instantiate the variable.  In such
cases, this predicate may yield a wrapped term in which two original
occurrences of the same variable are converted differently; one as a
variable and another as a non-variable term.  This is an inherent
problem of the specification of this predicate and probably will never
be fixed.  Thus, applying this predicate to non-ground terms should be
restricted to certain metalevel programs, such as debugging utilities.

The following predicates are provided in the module
@code{system_control}.
@pindex @code{system_control}

@defop {Predicate} {system_control} postmortem +Module +Goal @t{-}Result
Registers postmortem processing after normal or abnormal termination of
the main program.  @var{Goal} should be a functor structure specifying
the predicate and arguments of the postmortem processing goal.
@var{Module} should be a symbolic atom specifying the module of the
postmortem processing predicate.  Only a single goal can be specified;
comma-separated sequences of goals are not allowed.

When the registration is done, @var{Result} is unified with @code{[]}.
Waiting for this will prevent further processing to be executed before
the completion of the registration.

If this predicate is called many times, the last registration will
be effective.
@end defop

@defop {Predicate} {system_control} gc @t{-}Before @t{-}After
Requests garbage collection and returns the heap size in words before

respectively.  The size of a word is the same as the size of type
@code{long} of the C language system used in the installation.

@section Timer
@cindex time

@cindex interval timer

KLIC provides real-time timers.  Although Unix provides only one timer
per process, KLIC virtualizes the mechanism and provides as many timers
as needed.

Implementations on host systems where real-time timers are not available
do not provide the feature.

Time values (both times and time intervals) are represented by a term of
the form @code{time(@var{Day}, @var{Sec}, @var{Usec})}, where @var{Day},
@var{Sec} and @var{Usec} are non-negative integers representing days,
seconds and microseconds.  @var{Sec} should be less than 86,000 (one
day) and @var{Usec} should be less than 1,000,000 (one second).

The following predicates are provided in the module @code{timer}.

@defop {Predicate} {timer} get_time_of_day @t{-}Time
The current time expressed in seconds and microseconds since midnight of
January 1, 1970 GMT is returned to @var{Time}.

The time obtained is that of when a goal of this predicate is actually
executed.  Note that ordering of goal execution is up to the KLIC
system.  The time reported is only guaranteed to be the time between two
observable events: when the parent goal of this goal is reduced, and
when the value of @var{Time} is inspected.

Note also that the reported time is what is returned by the underlying
operating system of the worker task.  On a distributed system, clocks of
constituting systems may not agree completely.
@end defop

@defop {Predicate} {timer} add Time1 Time2 @t{-}Time
@defopx {Predicate} {timer} sub Time1 Time2 @t{-}Time
Computes sum and difference of two time values, respectively.
@end defop

@defop {Predicate} {timer} compare Time1 Time2 @t{-}Result
Compares two time values @var{Time1} and @var{Time2} and returns the
result in @var{Result}.  The result is @code{<} if @var{Time1} is
smaller than (or before) @var{Time2}, @code{=} if they are the same,
@code{>} if @var{Time1} is larger than (or after) @var{Time2}.
@end defop

@defop {Predicate} {timer} instantiate_at Time @t{-}Var
@defopx {Predicate} {timer} instantiate_after Interval @t{-}Var
Unifies @var{Var} with a symbolic atom @code{[]} at the time specified.
The former predicate does this @emph{at} the specified time, while the
latter does this @emph{after} the specified time interval.  If the
specified time has already passed, the variable may be instantiated
immediately.

Note that instantiation may be delayed arbitrarily long.  Reasonable
implementations should have short delays.
@end defop

@defop {Predicate} {timer} instantiate_every Interval Stop @t{-}Var
Incrementally instantiate @var{Var} with a list of symbolic atom
@code{[]}.  The first element is instantiated after the time interval
specified, the second after time twice the specified value, etc.
It will be repeated forever unless the argument @var{Stop} becomes
instantiated, on that occasion, the list will be terminated.

Note that instantiation may be delayed arbitrarily long.  Reasonable
implementations should have short delays.

After proper installation, KL1 programs can be compiled into C program
and then to executables by the command @code{klic}.  @code{klic} is a
compiler driver that allows various options.

@node Command for Compilation, Compiler Options, Compiling, Compiling
@subsection Command for Compilation

By simply running @code{klic} command with the name of KL1 program
source file with the trailing @code{.kl1} as an argument, that program
will be compiled into C and then to an executable format.

For example, to compile @code{@var{XXX}.kl1}, type in:

@example
% klic @var{XXX}.kl1
@end example

The compilation result will be found in @code{a.out}.  If you want the
compilation result to be named @code{@var{YYY}}, do the following.

@example
% klic -o @var{YYY} @var{XXX}.kl1
@end example

If your program is divided into several files, say @code{@var{XXX}.kl1},
@code{@var{YYY}.kl1} and @code{@var{ZZZ}.kl1}, you can compile and link
them together by the following.

@example
% klic @var{XXX}.kl1 @var{YYY}.kl1 @var{ZZZ}.kl1
@end example

It is also possible to separately compile several KL1 source files and
link them afterwards.  To avoid linkage errors, you have to stop before
linkage by giving the @code{-c} flag, as follows.

@example
% klic -c @var{XXX}.kl1
% klic -c @var{YYY}.kl1
% klic -c @var{ZZZ}.kl1
@end example

Finally, you have to link all of them together by the following.

@example
% klic @var{XXX}.o @var{YYY}.o @var{ZZZ}.o
@end example

See @xref{Compiler Options}, for details of compilation flags.

If you want to link program pieces written directly in C, say
@code{@var{CCC}.c} and @code{@var{DDD}.c}, with pieces written in KL1,
@code{@var{XXX}.kl1} and @code{@var{YYY}.kl1}, simply do the following.

@example
% klic @var{CCC}.c @var{DDD}.c @var{XXX}.kl1 @var{YYY}.kl1
@end example

The order of files specified does not matter.  C functions can be
invoked from within inline-expanded codes (@pxref{Inline C Code}).

programs to be linked together are distributed to multiple
directories.

@item -X@var{directory}
Initiate the database file @code{klic.db} from the database initiation
file @code{klicdb.init} under the specified directory, when the database

@subsection How KLIC Compiler Works

Understanding how KL1 programs are compiled and executed may help
understanding the usage of KLIC in further depth.

The system consists of the following three modules.

@itemize @bullet
@item
KLIC compiler
@item
KLIC database manager
@item
KLIC runtime system
@end itemize

KL1 programs are compiled using the KLIC compiler into C programs.  It
also generates files @code{@var{FILE}.ext} containing information on
atoms and functors used in the program.  The information in @code{.ext}
files for programs to be linked together is merged together later by the
database manager, into files @code{atom.h}, @code{funct.h},
@code{atom.c}, @code{funct.c} and @code{predicates.c}.

The object C program is then compiled by a C compiler, with headers
provided by the KLIC runtime system, @code{atom.h} and @code{funct.h}.
The files @code{atom.c}, @code{funct.c} and @code{predicates.c} are also
compiled, and linked together with the runtime system
(@code{predicates.c} is linked only with debugging runtime).

Compilation, database management and linkage are governed by a driver
program named @code{klic}.  This program @code{klic} plays a role
similar to @code{cc} and @code{make} combined.  @code{cc} controls the C
preprocessor, the C compiler kernel and the linker; @code{klic} controls
the KL1-to-C compiler, the C compiler, the KL1 program database manager
and the linker.  @code{make} selectively executes compilation only when
needed by examining the file dates; @code{klic} works similarly.

@node Running, Tracing, Compiling, Using KLIC
@section Running Programs Compiled with KLIC
@cindex running

You can simply run the compiled excutable.  If you compiled your program
into the file @code{a.out}, you simply give the file name @code{./a.out}
to the shell you are using.

The predicate @code{main} with no arguments in the module @code{main}
will be the initial goal to be executed (@pxref{Initial Goal}).

@menu
* Runtime Switches::            Runtime command line switches
@end menu

@node Runtime Switches,  , Running, Running
@subsection Runtime Switches for Programs Compiled with KLIC

The following options are available on running the compiled
executable.

@table @t
@item -h @var{size}
Specifies initial heap size in  words.  As copying garbage collection is
used, memory size actually used for heap will  be twice this  size.  The
size  can be specified  directly  (such  as  @code{2097152}) or  with  a
postfix @code{k} or  @code{m} (as @code{2048k} or @code{2m})  to specify
units of 2^10 or 2^20 words.  The default heap size is determined by the
macro @code{HEAPSIZE},  which is 24k in the original distribution.   The
length of one word is the same as the length of the type @code{long int}
in C, that depends on the hardware and the C compiler you use.  The heap
size will be increased automatically according  to options @code{-H} and
@code{-a}.

@item -H @var{size}
Specifies maximum heap size in words.  Automatic heap expansion
mechanism will never try to expand the heap above the size specified by
this option.  The default value is infinite.

@item -a @var{ratio}
Specifies threashold active cell ratio as a floating point number.  If
the ratio of the space occupied by active (non-garbage) cells in the
heap space is above this threshold, the heap size will be doubled in the
next garbage collection, as far as the size doesn't exceed the maximum
size specified by the @code{-H} option.  The default value is
0.5.

@item -g
Specifies that time required for garbage collection is to be measured.
As garbage collection will not take long for small heap sizes, the
measurement overhead can be more than that.  Thus, by default, garbage
collection timing is disabled.

@item -s
Specifies suspension statistics.  After execution of the program,
suspended predicates and numbers of their suspensions are reported.
This option is available when the debugging version of the runtime
library is linked, which is the default setting (@pxref{Compiler
Options}).

@item -t
Specifies to start execution with tracing (@pxref{Tracing, , Tracing
Program Execution}).  Tracing is only possible when the debugging
version of the runtime library is linked, which is the default setting.
The non-debugging version of the runtime library can be specified by
compilation time options (@pxref{Compiler Options}).
@end table

When all the ready goals have been executed, the program will stop.  If
there remain any goals awaiting for input data and if the program is
linked with the debugging runtime library, it will try to detect which
goal is problematic and report such a goal.  Otherwise, if the linked
library is a non-debugging version, only the number of such remaining
goals is reported.

@node Preparing for Trace, Trace Ports, Tracing, Tracing
@subsection Preparation for Traced Execution

To use the tracing feature, you have to link your program with the
debugging version of the runtime library.  The debugging version is used
by default, but when you give the @code{-n} option to the compilation
command @code{klic}, tracing will not be available.

If you already have compiled and linked the program with the @code{-n}
option, you don't have to recompile the program from scratch; running
the command @code{klic} again without the @code{-n} option will only
link the object with the debugging version of the runtime library, which
takes much shorter time.

To trace execution of a program, simply run your program with @code{-t}
option (@pxref{Runtime Switches, , Runtime Switches for Programs
Compiled with KLIC}).

@node Trace Ports, Output of Tracer, Preparing for Trace, Tracing
@subsection Trace Ports
@cindex port

Execution of KL1 programs proceeds as follows.

@enumerate
@item
The initial goal @code{main:main} is put into a pool of goals to be
executed.

@item
One goal is taken from the goal pool (@code{CALL}).

@item
The goal is matched against the program clauses.

@item
If any of the clauses matches the goal, the goal is reduced into
subgoals and they are put back to the goal pool (@code{REDUCE}).

@item
If no clause matches the goal, then the whole computation will be
aborted (@code{FAIL}).

@item
If values of goal arguments or their substructures are not defined and
thus it is not possible yet to decide whether some clauses will match
the goal or not, the goal is put into another goal pool awaiting for
required values (@code{SUSPEND}).

@item
If there still remain some goals in the goal pool, loop back to the
step 2.
@end enumerate

Execution of a goal can be traced on four of the above listed points,
numbered 2, 4, 5 and 6.  Such points of interest are called @dfn{trace
ports} and referenced as @code{CALL}, @code{REDUCE}, @code{FAIL} and
@code{SUSPEND} ports, respectively.

Those who are accustomed to the four-port trace model of Prolog may
wonder why two other ports of Prolog, @code{EXIT} and @code{REDO} are
missing.  The @code{REDO} port does not exist because KL1 programs do
not backtrack.  The @code{EXIT} port is not traced for two reasons.
First, keeping track of all the goal-subgoal hierarchy is much more
costly for a concurrent language such as KL1 than for sequential
languages such as Prolog.  Many different subtrees of the hierarchy may
run interleaving each other, because of the data-flow synchronization
feature.  The other reason is that, KL1 programs are often written as a
set of communicating processes each defined as a goal calling the same
predicate in a tail-recursive fashion.  Such processes (sometimes called
@dfn{perpetual processes}) will almost never finish and detecting their
termination is not as meaningful as in Prolog.

@node Output of Tracer, Controlling Trace, Trace Ports, Tracing
@subsection Format of Trace Display

Below is our sample program for explanation here.

@example
:- module main.

main :- nrev([1,2],X), builtin:print(X).

nrev([], R) :- R = [].
nrev([W|X], R) :- nrev(X, XR), append(XR, [W], R).

append([], Y, Z) :- Z = Y.
append([W|X], Y, WZ) :- WZ = [W|Z], append(X, Y, Z).
@end example

@noindent
Listed below is output of a full trace of execution of the sample
program.

@example
   1 CALL:main:main? 
   1 REDU:main:main :-
   2   0:+nrev([1,2],_4)
   3   1:+builtin:print(_4)? 
   2 CALL:main:nrev([1,2],_4)? 
   2 REDU:main:nrev([1,2],_4) :-
   4   0:+nrev([2],_D)

   4 CALL:main:nrev([2],_D)? 
   4 REDU:main:nrev([2],_D) :-
   6   0:+nrev([],_18)
   7   1:+append(_18,[2],_D)? 
   6 CALL:main:nrev([],_18)? 
   6 REDU:main:nrev([],[])? 
   7 CALL:main:append([],[2],_D)? 
   7 REDU:main:append([],[2],[2])? 
   5 CALL:main:append([2],[1],_4)? 
   5 REDU:main:append([2],[1],[2|_1F]) :-
   8   0:+append([],[1],_1F)? 
   8 CALL:main:append([],[1],_1F)? 
   8 REDU:main:append([],[1],[1])? 
   3 CALL:builtin:print([2,1])? 
[2,1]
   3 REDU:builtin:print([2,1])? 
@end example

As this program does not make any suspensions nor failures, all the
trace outputs here are either at the call or the reduce port (marked
as @code{REDU}).

The first line of the above is the trace of the call port of the
initial goal @code{main:main}.

@example
   1 CALL:main:main? 
@end example

@noindent
All the traced goals are given a unique identifier (an integer value) to
distinguish them among themselves.  The number @code{1} in the first
column here is the identifier of the initial goal.

The initial goal matches the first clause defined in the program and
thus reduced into subgoals as defined in the program clause.  This
reduction is traced as follows.

@example
   1 REDU:main:main :-
   2   0:+nrev([1,2],_4)
   3   1:+builtin:print(_4)? 
@end example

@noindent
This shows that the original goal @code{main:main} with ID 1 has been
reduced into two new goals, @code{main:nrev([1, 2], _4)} and
@code{builtin:print(_4)}, with IDs 2 and 3 respectively.

The numbers 0 and 1 following the IDs 2 and 3 of the two new goals are
sequential numbers for the subgoals generated by the reduction.  They
are used by some tracer commands to identify which subgoal to apply the
command to.  Unlike unique goal IDs that have global meaning, these
subgoal numbers are meaningful only at this specific port.

Next comes @code{:}, which means the subgoal is an ordinary subgoal of
the parent goal.  There are other possibilities here.  The character
@code{*} means that the goal following it is also a subgoal, but is
given a priority different from the parent.  The priority is displayed
in a pseudo-pragma format.  The character @code{!} means that the goal
following it is not actually a subgoal reduced from the parent goal, but
is a goal awaiting for some variable value which has just waken up as
this reduction gave some concrete value to the variable.  The character
@code{#} similarly indicates a goal waken up, but with a priority
different from the parent.

Then comes either @code{+} or @code{-}.  @code{+} means that the subgoal
will be traced if you simply continue the execution, and @code{-} means
it will not.  This can be changed by giving some tracer commands
described below.  In the example above, all of the subgoals have
@code{+} as all goals are traced.

Then the module name, a colon character, and the predicate name of the
subgoal are displayed.  The module name for predicates defined in the
same module as the predicate of the parent goal is omitted with the
colon for brevity.  In the above example, the subgoal calling
@code{nrev} (that is @code{main}) does not have its module name
displayed, as it is the same as the parent goal @code{main:main}.

Finally comes the argument list in parentheses separated by commas.  The
second argument of nrev and the only argument of print is @code{_4},
which corresponds to a variable corresponding to @code{X} in the source
program.  As variables are newly allocated for all incarnation of
predicate clauses, and as two or more variables can be unified together,
displaying their original names in the source program is not meaningful.
They are given unique names such as @code{_4}.

Actually, this number 4 is related to the physical memory address of the
variable.  It will thus change completely by garbage collections.
However, as garbage collections are not so frequent, the address
information is still quite useful for debugging.

The trace output stops after displaying all the subgoals and a question
mark.  Here, you can input one of the trace commands described below.

@subsubsection Controlling Tracing of the Traced Goal

The following commands are available for controlling program execution.

@table @asis
@item Continue: @code{c} or simply @kbd{@key{RET}}
Continues stepping execution.  Subgoal marked as @code{-} are not
traced even in stepping mode.

@item Leap: @code{l}
Continues execution without tracing until a spy point is encountered.
@xref{Spying}, for details.

@item Skip: @code{s}
Continues execution of the traced goal and all subgoals thereof without
tracing them at all.  Even spy points are neglected.

@item Abort: @code{a}
Aborts whole execution of the program.

@subsubsection Controlling Tracing of Newly Created Subgoals

Tracing of each subgoal (displayed as @code{+} or @code{-}) can be
changed by the following commands.

@table @asis
@item Trace: @code{+} @var{subgoal_number} @dots{}
Switches on the trace of the specified subgoal(s).  Multiple subgoal
numbers separated by spaces can be specified.  If no subgoal numbers are
given, all the subgoals become traced.

@item No Trace: @code{-} @var{subgoal_number} @dots{}
Switches off the trace of the specified subgoal(s).  Multiple subgoal
numbers separated by spaces can be specified.  If no subgoal numbers are
given, all the subgoals become untraced.

@item Toggle Trace: @var{subgoal_number} @dots{}
Toggles the trace switch of the specified subgoal(s).  Multiple subgoal
numbers separated by spaces can be specified.
@end table

@node Predicate Control,  , Subgoal Control, Controlling Trace
@subsubsection Changing Default Trace of Predicates

By default, all the subgoals of a goal will have trace switch on
(@code{+}) initially at the reduce port.  This default setting can be
changed predicate by predicate using commands described in this section,
so that predicates you are not interested in will not be traced by
default.

In what follows, command arguments <predicate> has one of the
following format.

@table @t
@item @var{Module}:@var{Predicate}/@var{Arity}
Specifies explicitly and exactly one predicate.  For example,
@code{main:nrev/2}.

@item @var{Module}:@var{Predicate}
Specifies all the predicates within a module with different arities.

@item @var{Module}:
Specifies all the predicates defined in a module.  Note that a colon is
required after the module name to distinguish it from a predicate
name.

@item @var{Predicate}/@var{Arity}
Specifies the predicate defined in the same module as the predicate of
the currently traced goal with the given name and arity.

@item @var{Predicate}
Specifies all the predicates defined in the same module as the predicate
of the currently traced goal with the given name.
@end table

Listed below are commands to change the default for given predicates.

@table @asis
@item No Trace Default: @code{n} @var{Predicate} @dots{}
Sets the default trace for the predicate(s) to be off.  If no predicates
are given as argument, the predicate of the traced goal is considered to
be specified.

@item Trace Default: @code{t} @var{Predicate} @dots{}
Sets the default trace for the predicate(s) to be on.  If no predicates
are given as argument, the predicate of the traced goal is considered to
be specified.
@end table

@node Spying, Port Control, Controlling Trace, Tracing
@subsection Spying
@cindex spy
@cindex break point

It is often the case that only some specific predicates are of interest
for debugging.  In such cases, ports for such predicates can be
specified as the @dfn{spy points}.  You can let program run without
tracing until some spy point is encountered, using the leap (@code{l})
command.  @xref{Goal Control, , Controlling Tracing of the Traced Goal},
for details.

Commands described in this section set or reset such spy points.

@table @asis
@item Spy: @code{S} @var{Predicate} @dots{}
Makes the predicate(s) spied.  If no predicates are given as argument,
the predicate of the traced goal is spied.

@item No Spy: @code{N} @var{Predicate} @dots{}
Resets the spy point on the predicate(s).  If no predicates are given as
argument, the spy point on the predicate of the traced goal is reset.
@end table

@node Port Control, Display Control, Spying, Tracing
@subsection Controlling Trace Ports
@cindex port

The four trace ports can be selectively enabled and disabled.  Disabled
ports will not be traced at all.

In addition, for each port, you can specify whether to stop and wait for
command input.  Ports where execution stops and waits for commands are
said to be @dfn{leashed}.  On ports enabled but not leashed, the trace
output will be displayed but execution continues as if the continue
command (carriage return) was input immediately.  For spied predicates,
even unleashed ports will be leashed.

Commands described in this section is for controlling such attributes
of ports.  They take port names as their arguments, specified as one
of the following ways.

@table @asis
@item Call:
@code{c}, @code{call}
@item Reduce:
@code{r}, @code{redu}, @code{reduce}
@item Suspend:
@code{s}, @code{susp}, @code{suspend}
@item Fail:
@code{f}, @code{fail}
@item All ports:
@code{a}, @code{all}
@end table

Listed below are the commands for controlling ports.

@table @asis
@item Enable Port: @code{E} @var{port} @dots{}
Enables the specified port(s).

@item Disable Port: @code{D} @var{port} @dots{}
Disables the specified port(s).

@item Leash Port: @code{L} @var{port} @dots{}
Leashes the specified port(s).

@item Unleash Port: @code{U} @var{port} @dots{}
Unleashes the specified port(s).
@end table

@node Display Control, Dumping Goals, Port Control, Tracing
@subsection Display Control Commands
@cindex trace display

Sometimes, full information of the traced goals is not desirable, as too
much information is only harmful for understanding the program behavior.
Thus, commands in this section are provided for controlling the amount
of information displayed on trace ports.

The amount of display is controlled by a combination of the following
options.

@itemize @bullet
@item By limiting display depth:
Arguments of structures below depth limit are displayed in the following
abbreviated way.

@example
f(a,b,c,d,e)    @expansion{}    f(..)
[a,b,c,d,e]     @expansion{}    [..]
@end example

@item By limiting display length:
Argument lists of structures or character strings longer than the length
limit are displayed in the following abbreviated way.

@example
f(a,b,c,d,e)    @expansion{}    f(a,b,c,..)
[a,b,c,d,e]     @expansion{}    [a,b,c,..]
"abcde"         @expansion{}    "abc.."
@end example

@item By specifying a subterm to be displayed:
Only a part of the traced goal can be specified for display.
@end itemize

The following commands can be used to control the options.

@table @asis
@item Set Print Depth: @code{pd} @var{depth}
@cindex depth limit of trace display
Sets depth limit of displaying data structures to @var{depth}.  With no
argument, prints the current depth limit value.

@item Set Print Length: @code{pl} @var{length}
@cindex length limit of trace display
Sets length limit of displaying data structures to @var{length}.  With
no argument, prints the current length limit value.

@item Toggle Verbose Print: @code{pv}
@cindex verbose print
Toggles verbose printing mode switch.  In verbose printing mode,
variables with goals awaiting for its value are displayed with the
information of the goal.

@item Set Subterm: @code{^} @var{N}
@item Reset Subterm:@code{^}
@cindex subterm
Sets the @var{N}-th subterm of the traced goal to be inspected.  With 0
specified as @var{N}, the subterm goes up one level.  With @var{N}
omitted, subterm inspection is reset.  For list structures, 1 means car
and 2 means cdr.

With subterm specification, only the subterm of the traced goal is
displayed after the information of which subterm is inspected.  An
example follows.

@example
  10 CALL: foo:bar(f(a,g(..),[..]))? ^1
  10 CALL: ^1 f(a,g(b,c),[d,e])? ^2
  10 CALL: ^1^2 g(b,c)? ^0
  10 CALL: ^1 f(a,g(b,c),[d,e])? ^3
  10 CALL: ^1^3 [d,e]? ^2
  10 CALL: ^1^3^2 [e]? ^
  10 CALL: foo:bar(f(a,g(..),[..]))?
@end example

At reduce ports, subgoals created by the reduction are not displayed
when subterm display is specified; only the specified subterm of the
parent goal is displayed.  With the current version, vector elements
cannot be specified as subterms.
@end table

The initial setting of depth and length limits are 3 and 7,
respectively.  Verbose print mode is initially switched off.

@node Dumping Goals, Misc Trace Commands, Display Control, Tracing
@subsection Dumping Goals

@cindex goal pool
@cindex suspended goal

It is desirable sometimes to dump all the goals in the system as a last
resort.  The following commands do it.

@table @asis
@item Dump Ready Queue: @code{Q}
Displays all the goals in the ready queue (goal pool) with their priorities.

@item Dump Suspended (Waiting) Goals: @code{W}
Displays all the suspended goals in the system with their priorities.

@end table

@node Perpetual Suspension,  , Misc Trace Commands, Tracing
@subsection Detecting Perpetual Suspensions

When some goals are awaiting for instantiation of a variable that will
never be instantiated by any other goals, such goals will never proceed.
This situation is called @dfn{perpetual suspension}.  Perpetual
suspension is detected by the garbage collector of KLIC.  Thus, during
program execution, garbage collections may find perpetual suspensions.

The system keeps track of the number of suspended goals.  When there
exist no goals ready for running and there are suspended goals
remaining, the system will try garbage collection to detect perpetual
suspensions.

Perpetual suspensions are reported as follows.

@example
!!! Perpetual Suspention Detected !!!
   3 PSUS: @var{Module}:@var{Predicate}(@var{Args}@dots{})? 
@end example

@noindent
The same command set as at a fail port is available here.

@node Install, Distributed KLIC, Tracing, Using KLIC
@section Installation
@cindex installation

Installation of KLIC should be fairly easy.

Host-dependent and preference-based customizations are made by running a
configuration script provided with the distribution.  Then @code{make
all} should compile the whole system.  You can make sure that the system
has been compiled without problems by running @code{make tests}.  Then
you can install the system by @code{make install}.

@menu
* Configuration::               Configuration script
* Make All::                    Compiling the system

* Make Distclean::              Cleaning up after installation
* Troubles::                    What to do when you have some trouble
@end menu

@node Configuration, Make All, Install, Install
@subsection Configuration
@cindex configuration
@cindex PVM

First thing to do in installation of KLIC is to configure the KLIC
system depending on the host computer system and your preference.

Go to the root directory of the distribution (referred to as @var{ROOT}
in what follows).  Then, run the configuration script there by a command
@file{./Configure}.  The script will search for available software tools
in your system and ask your preferences.

The default shell programs on some Unix systems based on BSD 4.2 do not
understand some of the constructs used in this configuration script.  In
such a case, obtain a modern shell (such as GNU @code{bash}) and let it
execute the script, as follows.

@example
% bash Configure
@end example

If you have built the system before and rebuilding it in the same
directory, it will ask whether the same values you specified the last
time should be used as default values.

The next question it asks (or the first, if it is the first time to
build the system) is whether to configure also for parallel
implementations.  If you want to install only the sequential system,
please answer @code{no} to the question.  See relevant sections
(@pxref{Distributed KLIC} and @pxref{Shared-Memory KLIC}), for further
details of configuraion of parallel versions of the system.

The configuration script will make three files.

@example
@file{@var{ROOT}/Makefile}
@file{@var{ROOT}/include/klic/config.h}
@file{@var{ROOT}/config.sh}
@end example

The last one records the specified options for reconfiguration.

The configuration script asks about the parallelism used in the
installation procedure.  You can specify non-zero parallelism here to
speed up the procedure if you are installing your system on a lightly
loaded multiprocessor system.  Do @emph{not} use parallel execution
features of the @code{make} program.

@node Make All, Make Tests, Configuration, Install
@subsection Compiling the KLIC system

After configuring the system, typing in @code{make all} should compile
the whole KLIC system, including the KL1 to C compiler and the runtime
libraries.

@node Make Tests, Make Install, Make All, Install
@subsection Testing the Compilation

After system compilation is finished, you are recommended to test
whether the compilation went without problems.  To do that, type in
@code{make tests} in the root directory of the distribution (not in its
subdirectory @code{test}).  This will compile and run several KL1 test
programs and compares the output with the expected output.

@node Make Install, Make Distclean, Make Tests, Install
@subsection Installing the Objects

After compilation, typing in @code{make install} will install the
compiler, header files and runtime libraries to directories specified on
configuration (@pxref{Configuration}).

@node Make Distclean, Troubles, Make Install, Install
@subsection Cleaning Up the Installation Directory

After installation has been done, typing in @code{make distclean} will
delete all the files @emph{not} included in the distribution.

Normal users should @strong{not} try @code{make realclean}, which will
delete C program source files generated from KL1.  A working KL1 to C
compiler will be needed to regenerate the C program source files.

@node Troubles,  , Make Distclean, Install
@subsection When Something Goes Wrong

When the installation procedure went wrong because of misconfiguration,
you had better start all over again from the configuration step
(@pxref{Configuration}).  The configuraion script will ask you whether
to clean up the system for reconfiguration.  Please answer affirmative
then.

Dependency rules written in Makefiles are inappropriate for using
parallel make features provided by some versions of @code{make}.  The
compilation procedure of KLIC relies on the fact that contents of atom
and functor databases are monotonically increasing.  Dependencies on
them are intentionally omitted to avoid redundant recompilation.  Use
the parallel compilation feature of the compiler driver @code{klic} that
understands the mechanism instead.  Parallelism used during installation
procedure is specified at the configuration step
(@pxref{Configuration}).

If you think the problem is due to the distributed code, please report
your problem to the following address.

@example
@code{klic-bugs@@icot.or.jp}
@end example

Including information on your host system (hardware and operating
system), your configuration (contents of the file @file{config.sh}), and
log of your installation would be of great help in analysing your
problems.

@node Distributed KLIC, Shared-Memory KLIC, Install, Using KLIC
@section Distributed Memory Parallel Implementation of KLIC
@cindex distributed KLIC
@cindex parallel processing
@cindex PVM

A version of the distributed parallel implementation of KLIC is included
in this KLIC distribution.  The distributed implementation is based on
PVM 3.3.  Implementations on other portable parallel processing
libraries, such as MPI, and those on system-specific interprocess
communication libraries have also been done, but not yet integrated into
this distribution.

Although it is based on PVM, the current version does not support
heterogeneous configuration: It does not work with systems consisting of
processors with multiple architectures or running different operating
systems.  Currently, we don't have any plans to support heterogenous
systems.

To install the PVM version of the distributed KLIC, you have to first
answer affirmatively to the question from the configuration script
asking whether to configure for parallel implementations and then
affirmatively again to to the question asking whether to configure for
the distributed KLIC.  Then it will ask for several questions on which
directories the PVM system is installed and which PVM library is to be
used, if several of them are available.

The following will be asked.
@itemize @bullet
@item
Root directory of the pvm system
@item
The keyword for architecture of the system (@code{SUN4MP}, for example)
@item
The name of the PVM library (@code{pvm3}, for example)
@end itemize

The current version has problems with PVM implementations which does not
use daemon processes.  For example, on shared-memory multiprocessor
Sparc systems running Solaris 2, the library @code{pvm3} does not work.
Use @code{pvm3s} that use sockets instead of shared-memory for
interprocess communication.

The rest of the installation procedure is the same as the procedure

@subsubsection Runtime Options for Distributed KLIC

The following options are available when running programs in the
distributed KLIC system, in addition to those available for the
sequential version.

@table @t
@item -p @var{N}
Specifies the number of workers (Unix processes) for running the
program.

@item -e
Specifies eager transfer mode.  Normally, KLIC transfers data structures
between processors on demands.  Thus, nested data structures are
transferred one level at a time.  In the eager transfer mode, nested
structures are sent at a time as far as they are already defined.  This
makes the execution more efficient for some programs, but may degrade
the performance for others.

@item -E @var{Level}
Specifies how many level of nested data structures are to be transferred
at each communication.

@item -I @var{MicroSec}
Specifies interval between interprocessor communication polling.
Whether such polling is needed and which value to be appropriate
depend on host systems and implementations of the physical communication
layer.  In most cases, its default value of 10000 is appropriate.

@item -n
Specifies printing out of some runtime statistics on interprocess
communication.

@item -notimer
Specifies not to use timer-driven communication polling.  Whether such
polling is mandatory depends on implementation of the physical
communication layer.

@item -relsp
Specifies that relative path should be used for the executable file on
spawning worker tasks.

@item -S
Specifies not to notify receiver processes of communication packets by
sending singals.  On some implementations, this may speed up program
execution by eliminating signal sending overheads.
