The following is an excerpt from KLIC.info in the directory
"documents".  Please consult the info pages for installation of a
distributed parallel system.

Installation
============

Installation of KLIC should be fairly easy.

Host-dependent and preference-based customizations are made by running a
configuration script provided with the distribution.  Then `make all'
should compile the whole system.  You can make sure that the system has
been compiled without problems by running `make tests'.  Then you can
install the system by `make install'.



Configuration
-------------

First thing to do in installation of KLIC is to configure the KLIC
system depending on the host computer system and your preference.

Go to the root directory of the distribution (referred to as ROOT in
what follows).  Then, run the configuration script there by a command
`./Configure'.  The script will search for available software tools in
your system and ask your preferences.

The default shell programs on some Unix systems based on BSD 4.2 do
not understand some of the constructs used in this configuration
script.  In such a case, obtain a modern shell (such as GNU `bash') and
let it execute the script, as follows.

     % bash Configure

If you have built the system before and rebuilding it in the same
directory, it will ask whether the same values you specified the last
time should be used as default values.

The next question it asks (or the first, if it is the first time to
build the system) is whether to configure also for parallel
implementations.  If you want to install only the sequential system,
please answer `no' to the question.  See relevant sections (*note
Distributed KLIC::. and *note Shared-Memory KLIC::.), for further
details of configuration of parallel versions of the system.

   The configuration script will make three files.

     `ROOT/Makefile'
     `ROOT/include/klic/config.h'
     `ROOT/config.sh'

   The last one records the specified options for reconfiguration.

   The configuration script asks about the parallelism used in the
installation procedure.  You can specify non-zero parallelism here to
speed up the procedure if you are installing your system on a lightly
loaded multiprocessor system.  Do *not* use parallel execution features
of the `make' program.


Compiling the KLIC system
-------------------------

After configuring the system, typing in `make all' should compile the
whole KLIC system, including the KL1 to C compiler and the runtime
libraries.


Testing the Compilation
-----------------------

After system compilation is finished, you are recommended to test
whether the compilation went without problems.  To do that, type in
`make tests' in the root directory of the distribution (not in its
subdirectory `test').  This will compile and run several KL1 test
programs and compares the output with the expected output.


Installing the Objects
----------------------

After compilation, typing in `make install' will install the compiler,
header files and runtime libraries to directories specified on
configuration (*Note Configuration::).


Cleaning Up the Installation Directory
--------------------------------------

After installation has been done, typing in `make distclean' will delete
all the files *not* included in the distribution.

Normal users should *not* try `make realclean', which will delete C
program source files generated from KL1.  A working KL1 to C compiler
will be needed to regenerate the C program source files.


When Something Goes Wrong
-------------------------

When the installation procedure went wrong because of misconfiguration,
you had better start all over again from the configuration step (*Note
Configuration::).  The configuration script will ask you whether to clean
up the system for reconfiguration.  Please answer affirmative then.

Dependency rules written in Makefiles are inappropriate for using
parallel make features provided by some versions of `make'.  The
compilation procedure of KLIC relies on the fact that contents of atom
and functor databases are monotonically increasing.  Dependencies on
them are intentionally omitted to avoid redundant recompilation.  Use
the parallel compilation feature of the compiler driver `klic' that
understands the mechanism instead.  Parallelism used during
installation procedure is specified at the configuration step (*Note
Configuration::).

If you think the problem is due to the distributed code, please report
your problem to the following address.

     `klic-bugs@icot.or.jp'

Including information on your host system (hardware and operating
system), your configuration (contents of the file `config.sh'), and log
of your installation would be of great help in analyzing your problems.
